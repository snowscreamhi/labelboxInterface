They took one sniff and backed away.

It was that CROWN and that ROBE that Mr. Newman was wearing that got my eye.<br \/><br \/>Royal Tea from Paul Newman's enterprises!  Why not?  I mean -- who deserved to name his tea Royal Tea than this superstar whose charitable heart was as good as his acting skills, and as wonderful as his ever-handsome looks?  The maverick in me has always liked the slightly-cocky half-smile Mr. Newman gave so often on the screen.  It was as if he had a touch -- just a touch, mind you -- of anger at our esteemed leadership, and at authority in general....just as I have?  Probably....<br \/><br \/>Anyway, I bought the tea, and found it's flavour really good.  Tasty tea -- thy name is NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, 100 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS, 7.05-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 6).  It has a light, but very bold flavour.  And a very good flavour, too!<br \/><br \/>I have recently found I must cut down on my favourite sweetener, SPLENDA. (TOO much of anything isn't good -- and too much SPLENDA, at least in my case, was beginning to affect my liver!)  I've partially solved this problem by putting TWO tea-bags in a slightly larger cup, (actually a 22-ounce glass), and this allows me to cut down on my Splenda packets.  It also gives the tea a more robust taste.<br \/><br \/>The message on the back of the box, from Mr. Newman's daughter, Nell, (who appears with him in Royal roobes on the front), is funny, and a priceless view into the mind and heart of the sadly late Mr. Newman.  Who knows, but that he, (and Nell), may very well have had royal ancestors?  He was certainly handsome enough, (and Nell quite beautiful enough), to have this actually be true.  The message is delightful, and I am so glad it has been continued on the box.  (One note to Nell, thoough: a perilous person is one who is usually a villain(ess).  I take it that you are NOT perilous, but imperilled, (someone who IN danger.)  Please check<br \/>with the dictionary to be sure I am right on this!<br \/><br \/>I've been fortunate enough to be able to sample the English FORTUM & MASON's Royal Blend Tea.  It is very tasty, too -- but also imported, and thus,<br \/>very expensive.  NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, is really tasty, less expensive, and truly an AMERICAN tea.  It proves, in a totally American way, that one need not be a king or queen, to enjoy the very best!  If Mr. Newman's ancestors WERE royal, he was continuing in the BEST of royal traditions, by sharing his bounty, (at a very reasonable cost), with those of us who admire all he did.  If his ancestors weren't royal....well, this truly delicious tea proves that ANYONE, no matter what their ancestry --  with enough heart, backing, and expertise -- can produce an exceptional-tasting tea at reasonable cost.<br \/><br \/>King Paul remains in our hearts, and in our happiest memories.  Queen Nell has our respect, our love, and our admiration.  This black tea -- the black tea that so many of us grew up on -- is our traditional tea, upgraded to a royal standard by being organic.  Mr. Newman's company also produces organic green tea, which has its own great taste and health benefits.  But for we traditionalists....black tea is it.  And organic black tea that is SO tasty, truly makes anyone who drinks it,<br \/>feel quite royal, indeed!\",\"B\":\"Blue Plate mayo: I love the flavor of Blue Plate.

Watermelon as a fruit is also pretty subtle, containing mostly water and so it has a soft flavor that makes it so refreshing.  This soft-drink is the epitome of refreshing.  This is also one of the best showcases for oogave's subtler, more relaxed carbonation (it lacks the aggressive `sizzle' that most sodas attack your throat with).  There are times, especially with oogave's Ginger Ale, where the lack of carbonated explosion makes the drink taste more savory and less refreshing than other soda's, but here the softer set on your palate is very nice.

We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br \/><br \/>The video is one of our taste tests.

I spend copious amounts of time and money on a variety of flours. When I found this mix, it was like a gift from God. I've since tried several other mixes, but none turned out as consistent a product as this mix. I do make some tweaks, however. I add a packet of unflavored gelatin (increases the protein content and helps with texture) and a teaspoon of xanthan gum. Often I will use my own yeast, just to make sure it's fresh. With these tweaks, I can easily make very good bread--without a bread maker (I have one, but I get much better results without it). I do find that I have to double the cooking time, but that could be from our area's temp and humidity and our oven.<br \/><br \/>I've occasionally tried some variations, such as raisin and cinnamon, poppyseed, etc., with varying results. Overall, however, this is so much better than the awful pre-made, mass-produced shelf-stable breads, better than other mixes, and as good as many of the local freshly-baked GF breads that sell for eight dollars a loaf in our area. My son still likes his frozen bread for some sandwiches, but otherwise we often make this.<br \/><br \/>Amazon's subscription-price is competitive, so we'll move to that!<br \/><br \/>Updated to add that I no longer add xanthan gum to the mix, and the results are just as good.  With better proofing, my cooking time is only a little longer than what is listed on the box. Try cooling the loaf in the oven, with the temp turned off and the door opened a little bit.\"}}"},

I bought it when Starbucks was giving free shipping and now they're tacking on $3 for s\/h. That pushes the price up too high, so I guess I'll get it at the grocery store where it is about $7 plus tax.<br \/><br \/>I like to divide these packets almost in half which amounts to about 2 teaspoons which I add to a tall glass of 1% milk leaving room to plunk in about four or five ice cubes. This seems to work for me and doesn't make it taste too bitter. I'm not a strong coffee gal, but this still gives it plenty of coffee flavor. I've followed the directions exactly before making a 16 oz. cup and divided it between me and my hubby. He thinks the strength is perfect, but I think it's too strong. He also likes his coffee black, but I like my cream and sugar.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think these packets are handy but not the best in the world. Maxwell House makes a good ice coffee.

Also available on eBay from my Danish friend who lives in the south (USA).<br \/>The waffles that you make with this product are called Liege Belgian Waffles. NOT DIET FOOD AND VERY ADDICTING - even cold they are outrageously good. Slap some Vanilla Ice Cream with berry of your choice - over the top!<br \/><br \/>For a Liege Waffle recipe we will need:<br \/>2 cups flour<br \/>1 cup pearl sugar<br \/>1 cup melted butter<br \/>3 eggs<br \/>1 (1\/4 ounce) package yeast<br \/>1\/3 cup lukewarm water<br \/>1 1\/2 tablespoons sugar<br \/>1\/8 teaspoon salt<br \/>2 to 3 teaspoons Pure Mexican Vanilla - substitute store brand Pure Vanilla<br \/>  (Tip - Mexican or any other vanilla should not contain syrup or sugars of any kind this is a cheap filler)<br \/><br \/>How to make Liege Waffles in nine easy steps:<br \/>1. Take the lukewarm water and mix in yeast, 1 1\/2 tablespoon sugar and salt. Let the yeast develop for 15 minutes. In the meanwhile you can melt the butter, but be careful - do not burn it.<br \/><br \/>2. Now take a large bowl and put in the flour, make a hole in the middle, pour in the yeast that you made in step one. Also add eggs and melted butter and knead until you get nice and even dough. Then let it rest so the yeast does it's magic and the dough doubles.<br \/><br \/>3. Now take pearl sugar and gently mix it in.<br \/><br \/>4. Again, let it rest for 15 minutes, in the meanwhile you can turn on the waffle maker so its nice and hot.<br \/><br \/>5. All there is left is to pour the waffle dough into the waffle maker and bake for 3-5 minutes. Because we mixed in the sugar late in the process it will melt and caramelize and give that special Liege waffle taste. Just be careful when you take them out of the waffle maker, caramelized sugar can make them sticky.<br \/><br \/>NOTE there are different kinds of Pearl Sugar - know what you are buying and for what!\",\"B\":\"Kinda weak: Tried these pods because they were a good deal.

The sauce is included in its own tray, inserted in the larger pasta tray and the heating instructions (in both written and graphic form) are very easy to understand.<br \/><br \/>The portion is large enough to be a main course and I found it satisfying if not exactly delicious.  Once heated (it only took one minute in my microwave), the pasta was slightly oily and the texture of the sauce was thick but certainly pourable.  The sauce is really the feature here and I found the taste slightly acidic, likely due to preservatives.  An herb such as basil doesn't really hold up well in a packaged product and so some consumers such as myself may want to add a sprinkling of fresh or dried basil to add to Barilla's rather weak basil flavor.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a good if not great product.

I have been drinking daily lattes for 8 years or so made at home, and buying regular at coffee shops for another 10 years before that.  I used to buy beans locally until they changed their bean - didn't tell the customer but I noticed.  Then I tried a lot of different brands and settled on Caffe Appassionato organic espresso beans that I usually ordered on Amazon.  They've been having some issues with (being out of stock) lately, so I thought I'd try this brand to hold me over.  I also had to get some Starbucks from the grocery store because I was totally out.  I thought the Starbucks would be terrible, since almost every latte I get at Starbucks isn't even close to as good as my home-made lattes, but it was not too bad at all.  Maybe I just got a good batch, because in the past when I've tried their beans, I wasn't impressed.  Now for this espresso, which I just opened 10 minutes ago and put into my grinder:<br \/><br \/>The first thing I notice are the beans, which do not look very dark and oily like all the other coffees I've ever used for espresso.  The grind, also, looks more light brown instead of closer to black.  The espresso itself (in steamed whole milk) tastes overly mild with a flavor which I don't know the 'technical' term for, but I just associate with bad small-town 'cappuccino' shops around here (You know, the kind of coffee shops that have tanning salons in them?) - the kind of coffee you order and then sip and then wish you had just gotten regular coffee with cream at the gas station because it's just NOT good.  No wait ... maybe this stuff isn't quite THAT bad, but pretty close.<br \/><br \/>I have my subscribe and save order on the way of my usual coffee, but I am thinking that I might have to go back to the grocery store later today and get the Starbucks to hold me over until Monday or Tuesday when it comes ... not sure I can drink any more of this.

I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.

I regularly eat hot wings, spicy potato chips, and I put extra hot sauce in spicy chili.  I like spicy food.  But this stuff is pretty harsh.  If you're very sensitive to spicy foods, I would avoid this one.  If you're mildly sensitive to spicy foods, just use a little extra water in the soup.

There are hazelnut shell mounds, comparable to the sea-shell mounds of Mayan and other New World cultures, still being discovered in Europe and Turkey and being excavated. Their bulk testifies to the nutritional importance of hazelnuts in prehistoric cultures. One such mound on the Isle of Man has been dated as 9000 years old; other mounds are mentioned in the wikipedia article devoted to hazelnuts.<br \/><br \/>Hazelnuts and filberts are not precisely synonymous, though most of the nuts grown in Oregon and Washington are hybrids or cultivars of the two. Genuine hazelnuts from Turkey and Italy are far more flavorful than the Oregon 'filbazelnuts', but the time-lag between the nut grove in Anatolia and the supermarket in your neighborhood may impact the quality and freshness of imported hazels. The Bergin Company, with headquarters in Minnesota, packages Turkish hazelnuts but labels them filberts. Go figure!<br \/><br \/>There seems to be a surge in popularity of hazelnuts in the USA and Canada these days, with Italian gelato\/ice cream becoming a standard flavor. Hazelnuts blend well with chocolate, both in ice cream and in candy. The whole nuts can be eaten raw or roasted, and their nutritional value is high. Hazelnut-milk is a very tasty substitute for cow's milk, with a far more agreeable flavor than soya-milk. On the other hand, hazelnut-flavored coffee is (to my tastebuds) an abomination. Hazelnut oil is wonderful in salad dressings, but expensive; it should never be used for cooking, especially not for frying.<br \/><br \/>No, I don't own a hazelnut grove, nor am I connected in any way to hazelnut marketing. I just like the things a lot, and hope to see high-quality hazels more widely available in markets everywhere.\"}}"},

So, when the opportunity came to try the new the Peanut Butter Fudge Cr&egrave;me I jumped all over it. Now, I am thinking I jumped on it a little tooooooo quick. What I was expecting is a combination oreo holiday cookie with a little peanut butter added for good measure. What I received on the other hand was something very different.<br \/><br \/>First, if you are expecting something similar to those chocolate (milk or white) covered oreos that come out around the holidays, with a tab bit of peanut butter you will be GREATLY disappointed. [I envisioned a plain 2 cookie cookie with peanut butter in the middle, dipped in milk chocolate. Meaning a variation on the old, well loved theme of their holiday cookie.] However, this cookie contained a really  slim wafer like oreo cookie, with a layer (perhaps too thick) of smooth peanut butter, covered in dark or fudge chocolate. What makes the holiday cookie (in my mind) a success (it is perfection), is what made this one new oreo cookie fall short. Don't get me wrong, this was not marketed in any form or fashion as the holiday cookie, but that is what I was thinking when I read the description. The main difference is that the holiday oreo (and maybe I shouldn't compare it to that) is a whole oreo dipped in white or milk chocolate. Maybe a better comparison (instead of the holiday oreo) would be maybe the Girl Scout Tagalongs (whose cookie is definitely thicker than this wafer) but closer to the taste. And while I enjoy peanut butter in a Reese's peanut butter cup or a GS Tagalong, I thought this had a little too much peanut butter, almost to the point of being overpowering. You should know that the flavor that lingers the longest in your mouth is the peanut butter, while I think it should have been the chocolate flavor. Maybe it could have been because the cookie is wafer thin, but while a thicker cookie would have masked (or toned down) the flavor of the peanut butter, it probably wouldn't have completely muted it. I also think that a sweeter milk chocolate, versus whatever kind this was....which seemed more of a dark chocolate\/fudge, would have made complemented the cookie better. Overall, I guess I was just a little disappointed because I was looking so forward to a tasty treat. This is definitely not that little something that I would reach for to complete my meal (although the last thing I need is a cookie). But my 9 and 12 year olds gobbled them up.\",\"B\":\"Weird taste: I was going to buy the 3 pack Torani Sugar Free Caramel Syrup offer from Amazon, but decided to try one bottle first, from my local grocery store.

But the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee was a major disappointment. I found this coffee to be very coarse tasting and bitter. Even using double the amount of creamer and sweetener I would use did not smooth down the grating roughness of this disaster. I tried to give it a fair shake and  used up half the bag before I couldn't take it anymore. I ended up having an idea and mixed the remaining half a bag with a full brick of unflavored dark roast coffee from a well known brand available at most any grocer. Finally I was left with a lightly vanilla flavored coffee that was flavorful, smoothed out to a drinkable state, and still had a good vanilla flavor.

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.<br \/><br \/>Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br \/><br \/>The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.<br \/><br \/>They conclude<br \/><br \/>On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.<br \/><br \/>Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook nutritional epidemiology, and the most-cited author in his field.

I realize anything can happen during shipping, but it could have been packaged more safely. In addition, the house was much smaller than I had expected for the price. The sides of the house are no larger than graham crackers at the most. The biggest issue I had was with the icing.  The instructions say to knead it to soften it for use. I kneaded, and kneaded, and finally resorted to running it under hot water to try to get it soft enough to use.  Every few minutes I would have to run under hot water again, or else the icing would be way too hard to be able to squeeze.  There is not nearly enough icing included in order to decorate the house as it is shown in the picture.  My son and I made our own patterns as best we could, and ended up laughing about it and simply eating the house unfinished.

I wasn't a fan of the texture at first but by the time I got to the 3rd bar it was fine.<br \/><br \/>What I didn't like is that one bar has 180 calories (80 of which come from fat).

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.

It comes chopped\/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br \/><br \/>Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br \/><br \/>The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br \/><br \/>There is really zero waste with this product.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"A bowl of cartilage: I heard about Miracle Noodles on Dr. Oz recently and couldn't resist trying them out, because they were touted as a delicious low carb alternative to pasta. Yes, I'd read the reviews and heard a lot of horror stories about how weird they tasted and smelled, but in spite of the negative reviews, I still got a pack of these because I'm a fan of all things Asian and figured that the poor reviews were from people not used to exotic food.<br \/><br \/>Well, I tried them and can now render my verdict. You know that saying, The truth between two extremes lies somewhere in the middle? Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to people's reactions to these noodles. They are neither what the haters make them out to be nor at all what the ravers claim that they are.<br \/><br \/>Let's talk about the negative reviews first. Contrary to what so many people are saying, Miracle Noodles do not have a pungent fishy odor or the texture of squid, calamari, or rubber bands. When I first opened the bag I had to really sniff for a fishy smell, since it was barely discernible. However, I did smell something else, a mild aroma not unlike that of sweetened soy milk. Not to worry, as these smells easily disappeared when rinsing and boiling the noodles.<br \/><br \/>As for the texture? Not at all rubbery, but very... gelatinous. At first I thought it was similar to those chewy fruity bits you often find in Asian puddings and drinks. But after chomping on the noodles for awhile, the texture became unmistakeable-- it was like cartilage. And no, this is not an exaggeration. The noodles had the exact semi-gelatinous, semi-crunchy consistency of cartilage. Did the texture make these noodles inedible or the worst thing ever? Not at all. Just very... jarring.<br \/><br \/>What about the rave reviews claiming that this product is a perfect substitute for fettucine or other types of pasta? No way, Jose. Because their texture has a fleshy quality to it, Miracle Noodles are more suitable as a vegetarian substitute for meat, fish, and poultry dishes, especially since they absorb flavors so well. (When I poured oyster sauce on mine, they really did taste like a seafood-like dish.) But as a replacement for pasta? Good Lord, no. Not in a million years. I can see someone hankering for these if they want to have something in lieu of meat, but there's no way someone would be craving these in lieu of pasta. There are no similarities whatsoever between the two.<br \/><br \/>So basically, don't believe the hype about this product, because it's definitely been mismarketed to the wrong eaters. Miracle Noodles do have some potential as a staple in the diet of someone either foregoing meat altogether or trying to cut down on it. But as a substitute for pasta or carbs? Not a chance.\",\"C\":\"Great taste: This gum is wonderful.  A little expensive and cost prohibative for people that chew alot of gum. No after taste.

I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br \/><br \/>I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br \/><br \/>How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br \/><br \/>How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br \/><br \/>I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br \/><br \/>General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br \/><br \/>Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product.\",\"B\":\"Taster Tins: Since I was introduced to finishing salts, I've never been able to go back to plain old table salt. I highly recommend trying a sampler set of salts to see which one(s) you like before buying larger quantities, and it's also nice to have a variety of salts for different tastes and food\/uses. Finishing and Gourmet salts are not just for Foodies, but for the average cook as well.  It is fun to try them on different combinations of food. You don't need to worry about getting too much salt in your diet if you omit salt during cooking and add a pinch on fresh, pure, non-processed foods at the table or upon serving.  Not only do finishing salts improve the flavor of so many foods, but they can add to the presentation.<br \/><br \/>A salt sampler makes a great gift, but if gifting, buy the bottles instead of the tins - they would make a much more attractive gift. I got the tins because I needed small and light containers, but you wouldn't want to set them out on the table or keep them anywhere visible.<br \/><br \/>As for this particular sampler and the seller:  It was shipped very quickly, and the quality of salts is fine, however -- it would have been helpful had they indicated the quantity (weight) of salt for the taster tins in the description.  It is indicated for every container, except the tins. (It varies: .6 oz., .9 oz., and 1 oz. depending on the density of each salt).  It would also be helpful if each label was on the top of the tin instead of the bottom so you don't have to turn each one upside down to identify the one you are looking for - unless you are able to see through tin.  The informational brochure that came with them would have been great - IF the type was large enough to read!  I had to use a magnifier and still couldn't read some of it because of the poor quality printing in addition to the tiny size, and I have 20\/20 vision.\"}}"},

Because there's only one cookie inside each unit, the proportions are pretty gross - you get the medium firm texture of the outer chocolate layer, which is fine, but a single interior cookie is not enough crunch to set off the sort of lardy faux-peanut-butter layer. My son (age 10) ate a bunch and probably would have eaten more, but I'm more of a discerning customer when it comes to both chocolate and peanut butter, so I stopped after my 2 experimental ones.

I switched her to an all wet food diet about 2 years ago, and Newman's is the best wet food that I've found on the market.  She is also fairly finicky, and LOVES the Chicken and Brown Rice formula.  I've tried a lot of other high-end cat foods, some more costly than Newman's, and several of them she has had problems digesting.  Not Newman's!  She really seems to enjoy this food and I don't have to worry that it is upsetting to her delicate stomach.  I've also found that it doesn't have that stench that some other wet cat foods seem to have.  The food is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in my local store.  Shipping and delivery was fast and pain-free, the box was well packed and none of the cans were dented.  I highly recommend this product.\"}}"},

I've only tried one bottle so far, so I can't speak to its long-term health benefits.<br \/><br \/>I DO know that UV treated reverse-osmosis water is the safest, although, as with distillation, the R-O process also depletes minerals.  Which is probably why Essentia has added electrolytes, a big plus.  My hubby has a health condition that demands he carefully monitor his electrolyte levels, so this water makes that just a little bit easier, with a good balance of magnesium, sodium, and potassium, without any of the added sugars of conventional sports drinks like Gatorade.<br \/><br \/>If you take vitamin supplements like I do, it's especially important to use a chlorine-free water like this for mixing and simply taking your supplements.  Chlorine SERIOUSLY interferes with the efficacy of supplements; this is especially obvious with green drinks, which will actually lose some of their color (and TONS of their nutritional value).

I agree that ordering any chocolate product in the middle of summer may not be the best idea. My order was received in excellent condition and the raisins tasted as expected. Chocolate Covered Raisins are one of my all-time favorite snacks. I love chocolate and the raisins give me the impression I'm eating something that's not so bad for my health. It's 170 cal for 30 pieces with 6g of fat. However, I usually combine the chocolate covered raisins with mixed nuts and regular raisins. Over half the calories are from the sugars in the raisins themselves. But, when mixed with the other stuff, the number eaten is way less than 30 pcs.<br \/>The packaging is nice but does make a lot of noise in the shipping box.

If you actually like the flavor of coffee (as I do), you will not find it here.  Starbucks states that they used a lightly roasted Latin American bean that sets off the flavor.  In my opinion, it sets it off too well, as the only flavor I could detect was the vanilla (and other natural flavors).<br \/><br \/>Sipping the coffee, it had a round, smooth taste and feel and low acidity.  The coffee press let the oils through that were trapped by the filter in the drip test cup and felt a bit oily to me, perhaps from the vegetable glycerin added to bind the unidentified natural flavors.<br \/><br \/>I grind moderately to dark roasted beans for each cup prior to brewing and actually like the flavor of coffee with (rarely) at most some subtle additional flavor.  The vanilla flavor here is neither subtle, nor completely natural if you happen to be someone who has cooked with actual vanilla beans.<br \/><br \/>Folks who like flavored coffee will probably like this as long as they appreciate the difference between flavored coffee and coffee into which a sweet flavored syrup has been poured.  Folks I know who typically buy ground coffee for an automatic coffee maker would enjoy this.\"}}"},

The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br \/><br \/>I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br \/><br \/>This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br \/><br \/>I'm not sure how well this would work for training though.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Try Gloria Jean's Peppermint Herbal tea instead: In the larger world, my favorite mint tea is Bigelow's Plantation Mint. Unfortunately, that's not available in the Keurig world. In trying to replicate Plantation Mint, I bought four sample packs of mint options directly from Keurig for testing. Gloria Jean's version is the best of the mints by far.<br \/><br \/>My problem with Timothy's? It has a strong twang up front and a noticeable unpleasant chemical aftertaste that tastes a bit like chewing a mint leaf whole. Even when cut with a LOT of water as iced tea is, it still has a too-sharp quality. I hesitate to add this lest I make myself sound crazy, but it also feels like it's forming a film on my tongue and throat as I swallow. I've tried about a dozen Keurig flavors as iced tea and none of the others make this film. So try it if you must, but take it from someone who's actually compared... there are better options for mint tea in the Keurig world.<br \/><br \/>To make iced tea easily in a Keurig, you need a very strong glass that won't break when taken from boiling to freezing. (Crate & Barrel's excellent Large Working Glass is the strongest I've found that still looks good.) In a 21-ounce glass, put your sweetener in -- 1.75 teaspoons of Splenda for me, 1.25 t for my husband -- then brew a MEDIUM cup of tea. Add ice to almost fill the glass. The ice will melt easily and will end up to be 1\/4 of the total volume. Stir and drink. The quality of your ice matters since the melted part will become at least half the drink.<br \/><br \/>If you'd like to try a flavored iced tea other than mint, my very favorite is GJ's Passion Fruit. It's out of stock, so I can't link to it. Until it's available here, try the close second-place tea: <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001CHDH9Q>Gloria Jean's Coffees, Tea K-Cup, Mango-Flavored Black Tea for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)<\/a>.\",\"C\":\"my husband's favorite oatmeal: My husband has finicky taste (and texture) buds, and this oatmeal wins hands down for him.

As other reviewers have said, the clumps do tend to get stuck in the sifter, and it can be messy to dispose of the waste.  However, after some experimentation, we have found the solution to both problems.  First, store the sifter in the empty pan, and NOT in the pan with the litter (when stacked, the sifter should always be in the center of the stack).  When it is time to clean the box (preferably not when there are fresh clumps, as they will break if you don't give them a little time to harden), dump all the soiled litter into the second pan with the sifter in it (if any clumps are stuck to the bottom, it is easy to knock them off).  Then, lift the sifter to remove all the waste.  Slip the whole sifter directly into a cheap 10-gallon wastebasket liner, and dump the waste into the bag.  Finally, remove the sifter from the bag, put it into the newly empty pan, and place under the pan that now contains the litter.  The whole process takes my son about two minutes, and he has no problems.

Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan all the time, then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.\"}}"},

It suffices well for this. Due to the large quantity, I never have any issue making too much as I can just pour it out with little harm.<br \/><br \/> - It is very easy to over brew this tea. For the first two weeks I did this constantly; the tea is awful when overbrewed. Take care with the quantity of tea and length of steep. Better to under steep than over steep.<br \/><br \/> - There is a very fine powder along with the rest of the tea. Be sure to use a decanter with a fine weave or simply shake whichever decanter you use with the tea in it to get as much of the powder out as possible.<br \/><br \/> - The taste, when brewed correctly, is good. The lemon comes through and adds a nice olfactory touch to the experience.<br \/><br \/>All in all, a good product, and recommended for green tea lovers. Do not judge the tea off of the first brew, like I did, but fiddle around with the quantity of tea brewed and the time steeped until you decide whether or not you enjoy this product.\"}}"},

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Not so good: I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this Real Theater popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br \/><br \/>Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is bad about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br \/><br \/>For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br \/><br \/>The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of real butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be artificial and thick.  Thick, as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent real theaters but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste.\",\"C\":\"Pretty good, needs improvement: I only buy organic, and decided to try a case based on the positive reviews.

Good amount of vegetables (unlike many soups that are mostly broth)<br \/>3. Low in salt, fat-free (you can add either, but can't take it away)<br \/><br \/>The cons:<br \/>1. Mushy overcooked veggies<br \/>2. Not much seasoning<br \/>3. No pop-top on the can (a minor gripe, but really I can't remember the last time I had to use a can opener for soup, making this soup less of an option to take to work)<br \/><br \/>Here is what I did to take this basic soup up a notch: added a bit of organic olive oil, a little oregano, and a dash of cayenne. This makes the soup much tastier. Sometimes I add shredded cheddar or Parmesan cheese.<br \/>Still, I can't fix the mushy veggies. It isn't enough of a convenience, with no pop-top and the doctoring required, so I'll stick to making my own with canned organic seasoned tomatoes, organic broth, and mixed veggies. Better soup, easy to make, more economical.

I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged.  As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry.  I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee.  I tried it by itself, mixed 1\/2 french roast, 1\/4 ...without any success.

Not a big deal, but how hard is it to tape the box shut, or at least put it right side up in the shipping carton?  In any event, was so happy with the assortment, that I will probably order two more.\",\"B\":\"It's water... Yep....: So I had the chance to try this water out, and I have to admit it seems like if there was going to be a health benefit you would need to drink it often. I received one bottle and I had some of it. The water tastes like purified water. Theres no weird chemical flavors  or plastic flavors. There is no odor and it tastes clean. It reminds me a lot of Smart Water.<br \/><br \/>I can't confirm if there are positive health impacts, I haven't had enough to show that I'm sure. But I can confirm it tastes just like water and if you are looking for something with a pH level of 9.5 this appears to be it...<br \/><br \/>Is it a buy\/try or don't buy? I'd say you can give it a try.\"}}"},

Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea leaves range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1\/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0010NR7C0>Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass<\/a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Five Star Coffee but a One Star Pod: I nevr tasted 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br \/><br \/>After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br \/><br \/>I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br \/><br \/>And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added flavored coffee creamer to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod.\",\"C\":\"Great for trainning: Excellent trainning treats.

I must say that Maruchan is the best brand of this type of meal of the 2 brands of similar prices in stores IMO (this and Nissin Chow Mein), and this flavor is great. To me it tastes more like a teriyaki than just soy sauce.. I think it has a very slight spiciness and sweetness.<br \/>In Maruchan Yakisoba there are always plenty of vegetables (unless you get the cheese flavored meals), and I especially like that this flavor has the wider flat noodles instead of the round ones. I tried one plain when they arrived and another one  I added cooked shrimp to. I think this would be good with added cooked beef, chicken, or pork too, but you're not missing out at all if you just make it the way it comes without adding any thing.<br \/><br \/>These would also be good to have in case of an emergency because the noodles seem to be pre-cooked and only require re-hydration. you could make it by just pouring boiling water (or the hottest water available) in, covering well, and letting it sit for a little while,  stirring it a couple of times while you wait to get all of the noodles and vegetables into the hot water. Cold water might work but it would probably take a long time to re-hydrate every thing.<br \/><br \/>Another thing you could do if you have plain ramen noodle soup packets around the house that aren't getting eaten and you don't have quite the right shaped bowls to cook them in the microwave is save the trays from these and use them. It says on the package not to reuse the tray, but I think that is for liability reasons. I have yet to melt one from reusing it. What I like to do is put the noodle block into the bowl, add meat and\/or a bit of small frozen vegetables like corn and peas, fill water to just under the line and cook until the noodles are done, then add the seasoning packet. I find the full ramen soup packet is too salty for me some times though so if you do this, I would add some at a time until it suits your taste.\"}}"},

Not bad weird or good weird, just different taste to what I am used to.  As for its claim to that it hydrated better, I drank it after mowing the lawn and did not feel better than I do with my regular filtered water.

I contacted Green Mountain Roasters, who make Jet Fuel, and they suggested this fix:  when inserting your kcup into your coffee machine, push the kcup DOWN onto the little puncture needle until it is sitting firmly in place.  Then continue as you normally would for your Jet Fuel cup.  The grinds-into-the-coffee should not happen again.  Reason: pushing DOWN releases some of the pressure in the kcup which prevents the problem.  This has worked for me and I haven't encountered the problem since.  If you have a problem with quality, go to the Green Mountain Roasters website and send customer service an email. They were very responsive when I emailed them!

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Better'n no peanut butter at all!: For some, dietary fat is not about losing weight or whether one kind of fat is better than another. As far as MY body is concerned, fat is fat is fat is fat, whether it's solid vegetable shortening, wild salmon, or avocados. One level tablespoon of ordinary peanut butter contains between two-thirds and three-quarters of the fat I can safely eat in a day or I get very, very sick, so it's either go without entirely (waaah!) or try the alternative products. This is what my dietician recommends for very-low-fat diets; she had samples of a few different products and I preferred this. No, this isn't better tasting than real freshly-roasted peanuts ground with just a bit of salt and nothing else, which is my peanut butter baseline. I'll admit that right up front. Some reviewers have said it is very sweet but I don't agree; to my palate, it's much LESS sweet than the mainstream Jif\/Skippy type. You do have to get used to the texture, which is a little sandy and very firm when refrigerated - stirring the living daylights out of it in the jar with the handle of a wooden spoon loosens it up and makes it more spreadable, although it will still tear up the puffy white bread like W*nder. It does melt really well onto hot toast (or pasta for peanut noodles, yum yum). I wouldn't eat it straight off a spoon the way some people do with regular peanut butter; OK but not great for ants on a log (celery with peanut butter and raisins) or spreading on apple slices (it tends to slide off), but for other PB uses - including the good ole PB&J - it's been a lifesaver.\",\"C\":\"It works for dry skin!!: I purchased the 15 oz size container of the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil because I was looking for something that would help me deal with my dry skin symptoms based on other reviews and product info.

Usually put it on after taking a shower and\/or shaving.  I will keep using this product until I can't use it anymore or I have to find something better.  This small container goes along way.  I purchased mine almost a year ago and still have plenty left for another year or more at least.

It was a bit more solid ... you could definitely tell the difference between the cookie and the fudge, but don't expect it to ooze everywhere.  This could be because the cookies were shipped and thus were not as fresh as normal, I'm not sure.<br \/><br \/>Overall they're OK cookies.  While it is impressive that Nabisco got a gooey center in there the cookies themselves were a bit dry and not especially tasty.  They certainly weren't bad, but if you need a quick cookie fix you should probably look elsewhere unless you must have a gooey center.  I didn't try dunking them in milk, that may have helped a bit ... it usually does.  But, if a cookie needs to be dunked for optimal taste it hasn't really succeeded as a cookie in my book.\"}}"},

Great I thought, now to add the usual 2 spoons of sugar. Did that, took a sip & found the coffee to be pretty good with some vanilla flavor still there. To sum up it's a nice coffee that I'll enjoy drinking even though I'll admit that I prefer the darker roasts like French Roast, Sumatra & Italian Roast. Not quite a 5 star coffee but still good enough for drinking anytime during the morning, throughout the day or in the evening.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Has zero basil flavor and tastes burned: I have never purchased spices online in my life. I've always had great service from Amazon and thought I would buy this product.  It was labeled as sweet, certified organic. First of all, it is not sweet. When added to tomato sauce a bitter after taste results on the tongue that does not go away. It barely smells like basil, it's bitter, and by itself, just placed on the tongue, tasted burned. I am not sure that even if it was not burned it would taste like basil. There is something off that goes beyond whether or not the basil burned in the drying process. Further, the leaves don't look burned or different than basil would generally look. The only way to tell that something is wrong is by noticing that the basil smell is very weak, that there is no basil flavor, and that using this product in sauce caused all the other ingredients to take on a bitter taste.  Even my husband, whose taste is off to begin with, said the product was flavorless. And because I opened the product and used it, I am not sure what to do about returning it. I've contacted Amazon and will wait and see what they say and will add more to this post depending on their response.  It doesn't seem enough to simply give me a refund.

And it takes just a few minutes.<br \/><br \/>Every person I've ever served this to has been impressed. This is the most delicious oatmeal I've ever tasted, they say. There's no need for any sweetener, though raisins and sliced banana are always a welcome addition.

Hope you enjoy too.<br \/><br \/>Sonya Hamilton\",\"B\":\"Dangerous for Some Dogs: My dog is an older dog, and I bought these treats for her in order to perhaps help her with her stiff joints. Within a few days of giving her these treats, my dog started having seizures. At first we weren't sure what might be causing them because she had never had a seizure before. The seizures increased, and we took her to the vet. The vet couldn't find anything wrong with her that might be causing the seizures. About two months after beginning the treats, I determined that this was the only variable as the seizures had started soon after. We stopped giving them to her as soon as we made the connection and the seizures stopped right away and she hasn't had one since. I don't know why these treats affected her this way, but I would strongly suggest that people stay away from these treats. Seeing your beloved pet go through something like this is very upsetting, but it is even more upsetting knowing that it happened because of something I gave her. Stay away from these treats, please.\"}}"},

As such this is a product you have to try to see what happens for you.<br \/><br \/>I am not a huge consumer of energy products, but I do like to them from time to time.  My standard has been Rockstar Zero Carb (i.e. no sugar) which is a full size energy drink.  I have found that it works well and usually I don't need to drink the entire can.  The appeal of 5-hour Energy is its small size and easy storage.  I don't drink Rockstar for it's outstanding taste, so if I can get the energy in something smaller and easier to consume, why not try?<br \/><br \/>I first tried 1\/2 a bottle of 5-hour Energy as some of the reviews made me a bit wary of how I might react.  I found that 1\/2 bottle had almost no effect.  On a different day I tried the entire bottle and again I saw almost no effect.  It is possible that there was a slight pickup, but nothing that would make this product worth buying.  I find this a bit strange because the ingredients and amounts appear to be more than what is found in the Rockstar Zero Carb mentioned above.  As such I would expect at least the same level of energy pickup, but again that wasn't close to being the case.<br \/><br \/>I am not going to throw in the towel just yet, however.  I plan to try the extra strength version of this product to see if that yields a better result.

For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Pros and cons...: Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br \/><br \/>Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br \/><br \/>The way it usually works for me is:<br \/>*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br \/>Where is it?<br \/>*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br \/>With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br \/><br \/>It's not as convenient as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and\/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br \/><br \/>Also...no delay in presenting? Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br \/><br \/>The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br \/><br \/>Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his\/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his\/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him\/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he\/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br \/><br \/>A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br \/><br \/>I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br \/><br \/>I haven't used them yet as a distraction or soothing technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s\/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br \/><br \/>Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a Lickety Stick.<br \/>These things really do just splatter all over the floor\/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br \/><br \/>I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning.\",\"C\":\"Can't wait to make homemade vanilla extract!: I got these yesterday, they smell great, are moist, and will be perfect for what I need.

The Crema e Aroma roast most reminds me of the little bar just around the corner from the Duomo in Florence and the bar at the bottom of the hill on Via Cavour in Rome.<br \/><br \/>I want to say a few words to the people giving low ratings because the beans aren't oily enough or roasted dark enough. If you've ever had a real espresso, one made by a licensed barista in Italy, you'd know that espresso beans aren't oily; they're not roasted to the point of midnight darkness. If you see black beans, it means the oils and sugars in the bean have been burnt and you're going to get a bitter cup of coffee no matter how you make it. It is the fine grinding and pressurized steam that make espresso so dark and strong in the cup, not burnt beans! Lavazza coffee is used in the great majority of Italian households and restaurants; I think a lot of the bars (especially in the northern regions) use a different brand, but most of the ones I frequented around Florence and Rome used Lavazza. I can tell you from first-hand experience that when you order an espresso in Italy, the barista doesn't get beans that look black; the beans are a nice light brown with no oily sheen...it is when the barista grinds them to nearly a powder and forces pressurized steam through them that the espresso comes out dark, rich, and wonderful.<br \/><br \/>These beans are the perfect color; medium to dark brown, uniformly roasted. When you grind them, the aroma fills the kitchen. (By the way detractors, that's another way to tell good coffee. If you don't get a big release of aroma when you grind the beans, it means they've been over-roasted and the oils are all gone...perhaps except for that little sheen you want to be on the surface...I'd rather have the oils still in the bean, personally.)<br \/><br \/>It is a real shame that $tarbuck$ and some of the American coffee companies have duped so many people into thinking that Italian-style coffee is supposed to come from burnt, bitter beans.\"}}"},

In recent weeks, I've purchased 3 cases of this product (that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in Western, MA due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends. I am so thankful I looked at this product before just bringing it to the make-shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks. This is what I experienced. What follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for Amazon, so it lists 2 cases vs 3. I purchased 1 first, then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors (creamy chocolate, cinnamon vanilla (excellent flavor, by the way) and Irish Cream (a bit too subtle in flavor for me-could have a bit more oomph). As such, you'll see me refer to just 2 below.<br \/><br \/>Exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact. However, contents (50 in each)are a sticky, gooey, unusable mess. I purchased 2 flavors\/2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment. While the majority of the single serve cups are fine, a large handful in every one of the 50-pack boxes are squished, cracked or just ripped open. Contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy, sticky and tacky, with what looks like dried and\/or tacky curdled milk all over them. I had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all.

I first must admit I'm a 20-something guy who has tried a number of protein products in my day, some good, most bad to terrible. My personal favorite is muscle milk light due to its flavor and ease of mixing. After trying Click, I can't imagine a better protein drink early in the morning. The flavor is excellent (I prefer Vanilla Latte over Mocha personally) and it mixes with ease. Great in water or milk. Recently I've been blending it in the morning with Almond Milk and a few ice cubes and it's awesome. I usually don't like Vanilla Latte drinks at Starbucks because the vanilla is overpowering but not with this mix.  It's really not even accurate to call it Vanilla Latte. I think its just an improved Mocha flavor, which is what I'd prefer. 15 grams of protein in the morning helps curb your appetite and its also low in sugar in fat which is usually a problem with protein drinks.  Biggest problem I can find is that Click is clearly being marketed towards women given the bright pink\/purple canister and female stick figure on the label.  Honestly, this is a product that both health conscience men and women should be happy to use in the morning. Right now I don't know another company that is offering a product like this (Muscle Milk has a coffee flavor but it's not as good) and given how important breakfast is to a healthy diet and a weight loss plan, Click is a great addition to your pantry. The price is fair, especially since you'll get a discount through Amazon.  If your interested in losing weight, give Click a try.

If you've had trouble pilling and you've run out of ideas, they are definitely worth a shot.  Of course, if your cat is super smart and knows how to spit out pills, the treats, in and of themselves, are still great snacks!\",\"C\":\"Incredible, delicious and miraculous!: Ok, miraculous might be a little over the top for most but in my case, I'm sticking with it! I add it to a Greek yogurt each day... sometimes twice as it is so good. The past few years since having my one and only child, I could not get rid of the nasty H (hemi!) that just wasn't fun having. Since eating this daily, it's GONE. I've changed nothing else in my diet or daily routine so I attribute this to the Spectrum Ground Premium Flaxseed with Mixed Berries. I keep it sealed tightly in my refrigerator and it stays very fresh. Don't let the idea of taking flax seed be an unpleasant issue. It tastes great on cereal or, as I mentioned, in yogurt. Though I buy almost everything I can on Amazon, I did find this particular product to be cheaper at my local chain drug store on the bottom shelf by the pharmacy. I almost missed it so look closely!

The container reminds me of roll-on deodorant.  I know that sounds gross but nevertheless it did. It is made where the dogs lick the top of it to receive their treat.  Okay, now all I had to do was let the dogs lick it and believe me they were ready.  They piled around me and all took their turns, it was so cute.  Now, did they come back for more?  You bet they did, each seeing who could get their tongue on it first.  I could tell to them it was a tasty treat and for me it was a time to interact with my animals and show them love. You can't just let them play piggly wiggly and lick it all in one day, because they would, believe me. You have to allow only so many licks.  I liked this product and so did my dogs and plan to purchase it for them.

The blend does seem paprika heavy, but that's okay.  I've tasted it just plain, and it does have a decent heat as well as a paprika\/ginger\/nutmeg thing going on.  The other spices all add little nuances here and there.  It's not too strong, so just a pinch on your tongue is enough to taste without the spices overwhelming.<br \/><br \/>I've been using this blend for East African dishes (vegan in my case), and I am extremely happy with the results.  I made an Ethiopian Chickpea stew from the Everyday Happy Herbivore cookbook and it blew me away.  I did put in 3 1\/2 teaspoons (the recipe said to start with 1 and go up to 4).<br \/><br \/>The heat level is pleasant without being explosive.  I would say it's a nice and even burn.  It's not quite as hot as, say, Sambal, but it is surely hotter than most commercial 'hot' salsas.<br \/><br \/>But after researching, I found that there are many variations on this blend, many with extremely rare and local East African spices, others with cumin or cardamon or nutmeg.  The spices that seem to be in common are fenugreek, ginger, black pepper, chili pepper (of some sort), and allspice.  Most had paprika.  So despite my not having had a huge variety of these blends, I cannot vouch for the authenticity, but it seems in line with most variations I have noted.  It seems that the big faux pas is putting turmeric and cumin in the same blend.  Luckily this brand does not.<br \/><br \/>One could make their own blend of these spices, but it's a lot easier to grab a good sized tin from this company, and be happy that it is certified USDA organic.

The Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL blend is a tasty snack that leaves you satisfied.  I am no stranger to combos, my favorite happens to be the Nacho flavor.<br \/><br \/>When it comes to flavor the Cheddar Cheese Pretzel combos are flavorful, and don't have an over salted-aftertaste you sometimes find with salty snack foods.  They do come off rather plain however, and the pretzel is a little overpowering.  Compared to the Cheddar Cheese CRACKER version, the Pretzel combination is the weaker of the two.  The cheddar cheese blend also lacks that a slight sharpness and has more of a Cheese-Wiz taste.  Nothing terribly wrong with that but it just feels like the weaker of the bunch.  The pretzel portion was crispy and fresh, having that pretzel-nugget taste to it.  Just the right amount of thickness and saltiness.<br \/><br \/>OVERALL I'd say the Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL combo is  4 stars.  The product makes for a very tasty snack, and will satisfy your cravings for both pretzels and cheese, but falls short of some of their other combinations.

Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that weird taste to it, however it doesn't altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I'd say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn't lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.<br \/><br \/>I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don't do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won't need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.<br \/><br \/>The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I'd say give it a shot. If you're a big coffee snob, then it's probably not for you. For the record I'm a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn't go out of my way to order it, I wouldn't turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there.\",\"B\":\"Emeril's Big Easy bold: If you like dark coffee this is a good one.

Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.

I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br \/><br \/>As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.

Some of the product was in clusters, a bit was in great chunks, but a lot of it is broken down into little pieces or partial pieces of grain and seeds (and those flax seeds are tiny!).

Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br \/><br \/>- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br \/><br \/>- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br \/><br \/>- Smells absolutely awful.<br \/><br \/>My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.

The individual wrappers are twice the size of the bar inside.  Not cool!<br \/><br \/>The positives:<br \/>First, it's tasty.  I happen to like the dense, cake-like texture and not-too-sweet cocoa flavor.  This is exactly what I expected and what I was looking for.  Imagine an ice cream sandwich without the ice cream.  This product tastes very similar to the sandwich part.  (another reviewer actually suggested putting ice cream in between smashed bars, and so it appears she felt the same way I do.)<br \/><br \/>Second, it's healthy.

I have a medically fragile son that was born severely disabled and had frequent, life threatening pneumonias.

I melt 1 tbsp per day and give it to him through his feeding tube (be sure to flush with really warm\/hot water or it will clog the tube). It helps prevent colds, flu and pneumonia and I use more (up to 4 tbsp a day) if any symptoms are coming on.  I tried other brands (Nutiva, 365 brand) and they didn't work as well. The Nutiva Organic Virgin Coconut Oil didn't work at all on his symptoms so now I only use Now Foods Organic Virgin Coconut Oil.<br \/><br \/>It is also fantastic as a beauty treatment. I put some in a glass dish with a plastic lid and place it in my bathroom. It diminishes fine lines and wrinkles, reduces pore size and makes your skin look amazing. I cleanse my face, dry it and then put it all over my face and leave it on overnight. My skin has never looked better. It's also the best makeup remover you will ever use and it's organic and all natural. Excellent for eye make up removal. I also use it as a moisturizer in the winter under my foundation. Use a much smaller amount (versus what you use at bedtime) and then apply your foundation as normal.<br \/><br \/>It's also great for cooking-I use it to make organic popcorn and use coconut oil instead of oil. Perfect for pie crust, grill cheese or anything where you would use oil. Plus it has a higher set point than other oils so it won't burn.<br \/><br \/>It's great too for burns of any kind.

It possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the gourmet coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives. Comedian Bob Irwin even compared the blend to kissing your sister. The day's first cup comes with a sense of entitlement; subsequent cups transition through the day (work, afternoon, dessert), while wanting both coffee's jolt and cozy sociability. (Instant? Don't get me started!)<br \/>That's why this new Melitta Riviera Sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise. It carries a full, almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which, for many, defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle. (This isn't surprising since Melitta's ad copy references the breezy feel of European cafes, a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shop.)<br \/>No less than Henry Ward Beecher once said. No coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils.  Riviera Sunset invites with its scent upon opening and doesn't disappoint when poured.(Hold to the preparation instructions; yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic.) Its taste, not its caffeine jolt, is your wake-up call. Recommended as a tastier, if somwhat pricier, alternative to major brands.\"}}"},

Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.

The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils).\",\"B\":\"Great for HCG Dieters...: Am so pleased with all the Miracle Noodles, so much so I have signed up with their 60-day auto shipment.

I had a bit of trouble getting the casing on the nozzle, ripped one - fortunately had soaked 2 since I did not know how many I'd need for 2lbs of sausage.  The cylinder does not hold much sausage, so you have to stop and reload often.  I solved the issue of air being pushed into the casings as I'm stuffing by removing the nozzle end each time I had to fill the cylinder.  It's very easy to operate once you're all put together, and have a great amount of control of the speed of the sausage while you're filling the casing. The greatest difficulty was putting on the casing.  You have to put the nozzle in the adapter (the piece in the far left of the picture), but there's not a way to lock the nozzle in place so you have to work at it to get leverage to get the casing on. I lubed the nozzle with some lard, so it seemed to go a bit easier.\",\"B\":\"Awesome!: I haven't seen these since I was a little kid.  Used to find them in Hi-Health stores.

Why does Zevia company have to invent their own holistic, all-natural recipe for root beer to create a soda with Stevia, why couldn't Zevia have just bought the exact formula from A&W and used Stevia as the sweetener instead?  That soda would taste great.  Unfortunately, this Zevia soda doesn't taste like normal root bear or even diet root beer.  It has a weak taste that's strange and unfamiliar, followed by the harsh aftertaste bite of the oils and ginger making me worry they're covering a weaker, unpleasant aftertaste from either the stevia or other ingredients in the zevia all-natural formula.  Bleh.  If you want guilt-free soda, but dont care about going all-natural, like I don't care, this is not the soda line for you.

The Protein powder acts as a nice minor thickening agent, but it has NO flavor. Also, to add a great deal of taste and additional nutrient value, plus fiber, try mixing the CIB powder with a fair amount of Wheat Germ: it gives CIB an excellent toasted\/nutty taste that greatly complements the rich chocolate flavor.<br \/><br \/>Using the CIB with the Pro-Mod protein powder and wheat germ is very healthy -- particularly for cancer patients and gastric bypass patients.

They are practically weightless, and have an odd texture like a cross between a packing peanut and paperboard, with a dusty exterior.  For some reason, I keep thinking of a rice cake or a meringue cookie when I look at these.  This is not necessarily bad, it is just different.<br \/><br \/>My schnauzer was more hesitant with this treat, I think it was due largly to the texture, as she is used to hard, crunchy stuff.  She took one big chomp and it crumbled, ending up as a pile of small pieces at her feet that she ate carefully, one or two at a time, until it was finished.<br \/><br \/>The smell of these treats is appealing to me, actually.  We have the chicken variety.  Unlike some meat treats that seem to radiate with a salty, bouillion-cube-like scent, these have a subtle chicken soup-like fragrance.<br \/><br \/>The package contains 4 oz., which works out to about 16 treats.  This is pricey compared to, say, Milkbones, but as a human who is willing to spend more for quality ingredients, I wouldn't call the cost outrageous, especially since I don't give these to my dog daily.<br \/><br \/>I prefer treats that work my dog's instincts to gnaw and chew, and if her teeth get a bit of cleaning at the same time then I'm happy.

It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br \/><br \/>I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br \/><br \/>Rooibus tea:<br \/>Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br \/><br \/>Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br \/>Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br \/><br \/>If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br \/><br \/>BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.

It's good that they came in different flavors, too.\",\"C\":\"My Favorite Tea!: This has been my favorite tea for a number of years. I love it hot or cold, but most of the time I drink it cold. When making it by the glass I take a tall iced tea glass, fill it with very cold spring water and add 2 Raspberry Zinger tea bags. In a couple of minutes I have iced raspberry tea! I drink it unsweetened sometimes but other times I add a little bit of liquid stevia (a natural sweetener found in health food stores that does not have any calories & does not affect your blood sugar) and it is delicious. I sometimes add some fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice. Sometimes I add 6-8 tea bags to a gallon of spring water and make the tea in the fridge. I love to bring a gallon of it to the homes of friends and family when we visit. My sister-in-law recently asked me what brand of tea it was because they had made some iced raspberry herbal tea and it did not taste good like the one I make. I told her it was Celestial Seasons Raspberry Zinger. You can make any flavor of their teas iced by just adding the tea bags to cold water. My husband likes it also! I love it hot too. Everyone has their own tastes, but everyone that I give it to iced thinks it tastes really good.<br \/>I have even used it to dye some doll's clothes for an antiqie doll some years ago. Teas can be used as a natural dye source.\",\"B\":\"comfort food!: I grew up in Europe, and missed having hazelnut products after moving to the USA.

Now, you can't beat this price (on the 100-count bulk box), so it still may be worth the compromise in quality.

Or perhaps by the time I go through 100 bags (50 mugs worth--the Tazo only needs 1 bag, the Stash needs 2) this will grow on me. I recommend honey as the sweetener for any unsweetened chai.<br \/><br \/>The packaging is fine, by the way--except now owing to the complaints they use too much. It's still the same plain box with individually-wrapped teabags stuffed inside, but then that's placed in an oversized box with too much of that air-pack cushion that Amazon uses.

I never thought to look before now, and have been ordering it direct from Starbucks and paying their exorbitant shipping charges. I sucked it up because I have to have this coffee.

I have been known to double fist the 32 oz iced coffees from McDonald's, I am that ridiculous.<br \/><br \/>When the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee came out late last year, I couldn't wait to try it.  I first drank it just with cold water and ice.  It is already sweetened, so we are good to go there.  I missed my sweet, milky iced coffee from McDonald's, so I had to experiment a little bit.  I tried adding a little skim milk.  That helped, it tasted even better.<br \/><br \/>Then I bought a gallon of 2% chocolate milk, and put a bit of that in instead of the regular milk. Oh my gosh! I have a better tasting iced coffee (in my opinion) than I can buy at any cafe.  It is so delicious, and I look forward to it every morning.  I think this VIA is made to be mixed with milk, it is strong so that the rich coffee flavor shines through even with milk mixed in.  When I run out of chocolate milk, I use skim milk with a good squeeze of Nestle Quick syrup, a good alternative.<br \/><br \/>I have been trying to find a good iced coffee to make at home for several years, and this is it...I was brewing whole pots of hot coffee and trying to add ice and vanilla syrup, and coffee creamer...bleh, it was so much work and tasted half as good as this!

I've been buying this sugar at my health food store for about $4 for a one-pound bag, and now they haven't had it for months and neither has anyone else in my area. Amazon's price works out to half that, if you adjust your order to get free shipping or are a Prime member.<br \/><br \/>Billington's Natural Dark Brown Molasses sugar is better -- much better-- than any other kind I've tried. Its wonderful clean flavor is completely different from the rank flavor of other brands of dark brown sugars I've tried. The flavor is reminiscent of maple sugar, perhaps. Another reviewer suggests toffee. Whatever the flavor is, the sugar is great on oatmeal, great to bake with, and I wouldn't think of making Linda Greenlaw's maple baked beans without it. (The best and easiest baked beans ever, my most-used recipe from her book <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000YFE8AY>RECIPES FROM A VERY SMALL ISLAND<\/a>)<br \/><br \/>Cookies, spice cakes, gingerbreads, and anything else with dark brown sugar for an ingredient are a whole different concoction with this sugar. Even Sticky Chicken Wings, baked swimming in half soy sauce and half dark brown sugar, taste better with Billington's. (There's a bit of mustard and butter in the sauce too, but you can taste the Billington's difference through it all.)<br \/><br \/>The sugar is in a box, packed very tightly into the inner bag (a perfect presentation for a gift: the box is bright and attractive). I can understand how the sugar might collapse into itself and cool into the hard brick one reviewer complained of, if it sat for a long time in a shipper's superhot warehouse.  I revive hardened sugar in a double bag system (sugar in the inner bag, top slightly open, an outer bag that I'll seal tightly, with a barely damp paper towel folded several times between the two), and I think I'd try this before sending a shipment back.<br \/><br \/>The other Billington sugars are very good too. If I were less anti-sugar and did more baking I'd consider ordering the three kinds together. An assortment of the three would make a great gift for my baking relatives.\",\"C\":\"FYI, the spirals are small: I bought this shape of Kraft Mac & Cheese for variety's sake.

Not only do I drink coffee in the morning, but I drink it in the afternoon, usually around 2:00, as a quick pick-me-up. I especially like lattes and cappuccinos in the afternoon, which I consider a snack.<br \/><br \/>What I like about this coffee is that it's an instant product -- the only thing you need is hot water. No brewing involved. I do recommend using a real measuring spoon and not relying on your teaspoon, though, when measuring out the product. When you mix it with hot water, it produces a really good, foamy product -- very much like a latte.<br \/><br \/>While it's foamy, it's not very thick, and I honestly can say the pumpkin-spice flavoring falls a little on the weak side. I've never really liked the International Coffees because I feel they come off as a weak-tasting coffees. I prefer a strong coffee taste, with strong flavoring, when drinking cappuccinos and lattes. This product reminds me of a coffee-flavored tea, with some spices added. It's also just not very sweet.<br \/><br \/>While the recommended serving is about 90 calories, I tend to use 5 teaspoons instead of the recommended 4 teaspoons, just to add a little more flavor. Making it with milk, instead of water, is an alternative to add more density to the product, but then the calories could start to add up. All of this said, the product definitely falls-short in the flavor department.<br \/><br \/>The packaging makes no mention of the caffeine content. My experience tells me it contains caffeine, but it's impossible to know how many milligrams of caffeine are in a serving. I find it provides an afternoon lift for a few hours.<br \/><br \/>If you're looking for an afternoon alternative to coffee or tea, and like spiced coffee, give this a try, but don't expect coffee-house quality or flavor.\"}}"},

Despite the name they're fairly thick.  The ingredients they contain are pretty basic and mostly all-natural.  A serving size is three cookies, which will not be terribly filling but will probably be fine for those who want a midafternoon pick-me-up or to walk away from a large meal with a little sweetness on the tongue.  It's 140 calories per serving and is a bit heavy on the fat (5 grams a serving, which comes close to being 2 grams a cookie) but then, it is a cookie after all.<br \/><br \/>Flavor is very much a matter of personal opinion, but I think it tastes great.  The brown sugar and dried blueberries are more or less equally present, and the distinct but complementary interplay of two mildly sweet flavors is more interesting than I would have expected from a cookie like this.  It's not going to satisfy a hard-core sweet tooth, but then that's hardly what this sort of product is meant to do.<br \/><br \/>Texture-wise, it's just a little bit crispier than I'd like, but not to the point that this takes away much from my enjoyment of the product.  And, while not exactly moist, the cookies are not at all dry, either.

That said, I am still happy with my purchase and enjoy this tea on a daily basis.<br \/><br \/>My critique of the drinkability of the tea itself is a mixed bag.  The flavor is in the neighborhood of my usual Genmaicha.  However it is definitely not the same.  The bready flavor of the roasted rice is overpowered by the Matcha tea.  In addition, to me Matcha tea is somewhat akin to instant tea.  Although many may disagree strongly with that statement, it is how I feel.  I simply prefer brewed loose leaf tea, and since I was not aware of the nature of this tea, I suppose I am a little dissapointed.  In the cup the tea is very cloudy.  Genmaicha in general is a cloudy cup due to the rice.  The Genmai Cha is about twice as cloudy, due in part to the Matcha and also the high percentage of roasted rice that I mentioned earlier.<br \/><br \/>The other factors to consider with this tea is the quantity and the pricing.  The Shirakiku comes in two vacuum sealed bricks weighing 2.2 pounds (1 Kilogram) each.  That means that you get about 4.4 pounds of tea in total.  That's a lot of tea!  Which leads me to the price.  After tax and with free shipping through Amazon I paid less than $10.50 per pound of tea.  This is less than half of what I would expect to pay for my usual brand.<br \/><br \/>Overall the tea is a great value.  Cost per pound is very low, but 2 Kilograms is a lot of tea.  And the flavor is very good.  So I would have to say that I took away two stars for the introduction of the Matcha tea, but I added one star for the amazing value this tea offers.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>Cost per pound<br \/>Flavor is very good<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>4.4 pounds of tea (you will be drinking it for a long time....)<br \/>Not a true Genmaicha (at least not to purists)<br \/>Lots of sediment at the bottom of the cup\",\"B\":\"Lite on Caffeine and Acidity, FULL on Flavor: I have been drinking Melitta Lite for about 5 years.  It is far tastier than any of the other Lite or Half Caffeine Coffees out there.  My preference in coffees is medium to strong brew; my coffee should taste like coffee. Melitta Lite certainly does have the body of a good coffee while being gentler to my tummy and my nerves.<br \/>Good thing that Amazon sells this in the subscription program, so it is delivered right to my door and I always have some on hand.\"}}"},

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Delicious!!: Because I am fairly new to matcha, I have been trying samples from many different sources in an attempt to gain some experience in the area. So far, this matcha is definitely my favorite. It has truly opened my eyes to the beauty of matcha and how great it can taste!<br \/><br \/>I was initially unsure about trying a flavored matcha because I was afraid that the flavoring would overwhelm the taste of the actual matcha. I finally decided to just take a chance and order some... and I was not disappointed!<br \/><br \/>When I first opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised by the sweet aroma. It smells like real grapes, not like grape candy as I had expected. As I prepared my first bowl, the grape smell became more subtle after the water was added. The familiar aroma of matcha then became more prominent. I had begun to think that the grape flavoring had disappeared altogether until I took my first sip. I was still able to taste the subtle hint of grape within the matcha. I am very pleased with the fact that the grape taste isn't overpowering.<br \/><br \/>The overall quality of the matcha is great as well! It is very finely ground and is a vibrant shade of green. It also has a natural sweetness, without bitterness, and leaves a great aftertaste in your mouth. This matcha's quality has by far exceeded any others that I have tasted so far!<br \/><br \/>Red Leaf Tea offers such a wide variety of flavored matchas, and for an excellent price--especially when considering the high quality of their products!

The people at Kind have mastered both taste and health in their healthy grains product.  I sampled vanilla blueberry Clusters with Flax seeds and found it to be the best granola I've ever tasted, except perhaps for the granola I have made myself.  It's delicious, low fat, and has an ingredient list that is easy to understand.  It can be enjoyed many ways, but just eating it out of the bag is great.<br \/><br \/>Containing 5 g of fiber, 750 mg  of Omega 3 with 100 percent whole grains, its list of benefits also includes cholesterol free, low glycemic and low sodium, non GMO and finally, it has no trans or saturated fats.  Those claims are amazing since it actually tastes very good and is a good addition to your diet of grains.  It is indeed a Kind grain food.<br \/><br \/>Other grains tend to be too sweet, or have had seeds or nuts that can crack teeth or get caught easily.  This granola is easy to munch, just eating it  out of the bag,  or using it for a topping,  or combining it  with milk almost like a cereal.  Since it's more expensive than cereal, I like to savor small batches of it when I'm hungry or use it as a yogurt topping.  I recommend trying it.  It's wholesome and quite a treat, a type of healthy candy for the conscientious eater.\"}}"},

I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br \/><br \/>Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea!

Their are other brand new homes on our street and I am using their homes as comparison to our bushes since they are the same bushes, shrubs, and trees (due to HOA) and within a year our bushes have almost bloomed fully (they have red berries on them and cover more area than before), the shrubs that we have died (dug under them and noticed they weren't in full clay\/mud there were huge rocks beneath them covering them from any contact with clay due to horrible landscaping that came with home), and as for the tree... it still looks the same.

I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue.

I often worry that the coffee may be old and have a wierd taste -- which has occurred twice. So, of course I was nervous about ordering this large amount online but said what the heck. It was a good choice. I do wish they would instant package the Breakfast Blend. That is my very favorite. Pike's Place is my next fav -- but not to be had in the instant variety either. This Columbian, medium roast, is quite tasty though. I'm having a cup right now and really enjoying it. Oh by the way, for the person who said the coffee is too strong and uses only half the package and the remainder of the coffee turns to goo. Tip: Do not pour the coffee into a cup of hot water. The steam from the water instantly makes the coffee hard to pour from the package and indeed starts to dissolve the coffee. Pour the coffee into the empty cup and then seal the package. A small paper clip works well.\",\"C\":\"Not what I wanted: I was looking for a non-alcohol vanilla. I had searched all the different ones being sold on Amazon and for some reason I chose this one without looking at the ingredients.

When my package came in, they had shipped the Coconut Creme and mistakenly bundled it with this Mandarin Silk tea by accident. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the Silver Needles and told me I could dispose of the Mandarin Silk Oolong as I saw fit. Well, since I'm never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.<br \/><br \/>This isn't a bad tea, first off. I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green\/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.<br \/><br \/>All in all, it's a decent tea. I don't think I'll order it again, but I'll certainly finish off this tin.\"}}"},
{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"I LOVE this product!!: As an avid vegan at-home baker, I use egg-replacer constantly. There are so many things you can do with this product. It works amazing in cookies (I usually add an extra eggs-worth than what the recipe calls for), it is perfect in pancakes and waffles, and anything, like a previous writer mentioned, that doesn't need to rise too much. On the other hand, you can make whipped cream with it and a slew of other things. However, this product has its limitations (most instances where you need eggs in baking it should work just fine). Recipes it is perfect for: cookies that call for whole eggs or egg whites (use flax and water instead for egg yolks or agar-agar in gelatinizing projects), whipped cream, pancakes\/waffles, cookie bars, and virtually anything that calls for eggs (mind you its a POWDER, and cannot be used to eat by itself). You can use this product in quick breads, cakes, and muffins, however I usually avoid this and stick with the flax\/water combo or applesauce, bananas, etc. depending on the recipe when making these things. Egg Replacer just doesn't have the eggy consistency of ground flax, and the fluffing power that normal eggs do. Also, you can use it as an egg wash, but it will not brown, it will just be shiny. If you want your bread for example to brown and look shiny and golden, I would try super-finely ground flax and water. Most importantly, this will absolutely NOT work in brownies or boxed mixes. Just don't do it. Trust me, I recently had a fiasco with some home-made brownies. If you are doing brownies, again, go with flax. It has to do with the low protein content of Egg Replacer, but I won't bore you with those details. Wow, I may seem like I don't love this product but it's actually one of the best out there and a MUST for anyone's kitchen. Why have all the cholesterol from eggs when you can use this in place of eggs for most recipes? And just because I personally choose to use flax in quick bread\/cake\/muffin recipes, doesn't mean it won't work for them. I've used Egg Replacer to make these things before ( I just have personal preferences ) and it worked just fine. There are only a few things that I wouldn't recommend using it in as mentioned above, but other than that it is fabulous!!!!!!!!\",\"C\":\"Light flavored tea: I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps prepare the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br \/><br \/>As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.\",\"B\":\"Pretty Good: I enjoyed the dressing.

When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.\",\"B\":\"Pricing is out of line: You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $60 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.\"}}"},

It looks the same but when I added several spoonfuls to my chocolate shake it did not seem to have the malted milk taste like you get with good quality malted milk balls.  Not sure if the product has changed or my memory thinks it used to taste better.  I did visit my daugher's family in Rhode Island recently and we got malts at the local ice cream shop and that was what got me started on this project.

And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br \/><br \/>I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

We went to using these for the benefit of my mother, who lives with me and has Alzheimer's Disease in its mid stages. Making coffee is one of the little things she does as her part around the house. Just makes her feel good that she's the one that gets our mornings started and using the filter packs makes it so much easier for her. This order, however, began to show problems about half-way into the box. Coffee was weak. We could drink it, but it was noticeably weak. This past week (we used 2 packs a day for 8 cups) it was just awful. Today, we couldn't drink it. Like colored water.<br \/><br \/>Yes, the thought came up that it might be the coffeemaker, so I poured out our cups and the pot then made another pot using Maxwell House out of the can (we always have Maxwell House in the house) with a regular filter, came out just right (bit of a shock to have real-strength coffee after three weeks with the lesser stuff, but it was good). So, I don't know if the filter paper had too much to it that the water couldn't penetrate it, or what was wrong. The amount of coffee in the filter packs seemed to be the right amount so I'm thinking it had something to do with the paper in the filter pack.<br \/><br \/>So, we're done with filter packs because our morning coffee has to be good.

They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this roll-on style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is just enough when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog outside of the bubble and give this new treat a try.\",\"C\":\"Blah, healthy but not tasty: I bought this because it seems to be quite popular amongst people so I decided to try it and see for myself. The flavors that came in this six flavor variety package were Original, Barbeque, Cheddar, Salt & Pepper, Sea Salt & Vinegar, and Sour Cream & Onion. Although I tried all the flavors, the last three mentioned flavors have dominated my taste buds to create the impression that Pop Chips is mostly of salty or bitter flavors. The Original flavor was okay, gives you an idea of what the original Pop Chips is supposed to taste like. It's cool that it's not baked or fried so it's healthy. When I think Barbeque flavor, I immediately think of Lay's Barbeque Potato Chips. If you can't match or surpass Lay's Barbeque flavor you fail, and Pop Chips fails. You can taste the barbeque flavor but it is very subtle. The same goes for the Cheddar flavor; the cheddar flavor is very subtle. I like the cheddar heavy on please. I'm guessing Pop Chips is trying to make healthy chips so additional flavorings like barbeque and cheddar are moderately laid on. As for the remaining rest (Salt & Pepper and Sea Salt & Vinegar), they're not very tasty and somewhat bitter to boot. If you like bitter than those flavors are for you. I prefer sweet flavors. My mom tried an unfinished bag of Salt & Pepper that I had laid on the table one day and later told me the chips were not very good and to not buy them again. Sour Cream & Onion I like when I'm really hungry or in the mood for sourness and have sweet liquid around to neutralize the sour. When I first received this package, I had touted to my mom about all the good reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed after I tried these chips out. I don't think I would buy these chips again unless I was seeking to eat a little more healthier.\",\"B\":\"ALMOST TOO GOOD!

When I ordered these here (also ordered from several other specialty sites) they only came with four packets :( No fried onions, and the chili paste was instead a chili powder. While they still taste great, they are not the incredibly addicting noodles I was used to as a poor college student in Australia. I still crave that same taste I got from the version sold in Australia. I wish these were the same so badly, but they are not.<br \/><br \/>I have also noticed a few other reviewers saying it does taste differently than what they remember.

Well, I should have just given up on using white coatings on anything, because this stuff is utter crap.  I actually don't think it tastes all that bad - it tastes like the coating on a Zero bar, basically.

I often eat them in place of jelly on toast.  But really - if you are searching for apricots to use to make a pie or smaller fried pies, these apricots can't be beat.

We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br \/><br \/>The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1\/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br \/><br \/>I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br \/><br \/>I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.\"}}"},

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Not the same strength as powder form: I'm a Type 2 diabetic and wanted to try the tablet form of Equal since it doesn't have the fillers as the packets, thus raising blood sugar levels. I did notice a few points difference in my readings before and after my first cup of coffee. Also, the sweetness level is not as advertised (1 tablet = 1 teaspoon sugar). I have to use 3 tablets and 1 packet of Equal to get the right sweetness that 2 packets give me. The fillers in the packets include a form of sugar and therefore make the packets' sweetness more intense. So, I can solve the whole problem by not using sweetener in my coffee, but I swear, I've tried that and just can't do it. My solution is: since I drink only 2 cups of coffee per day, I'll continue to use 2 packets of Equal per cup and get the taste I want, while searching for other alternatives.

The price is exceptional.  No complaints in that department, but I personally found this pickle a bit too salty.  The consistency is also different, not as chunky.<br \/><br \/>Now these things are a matter of personal taste, likely more so with respect to food than anything else I can think of.  It is also a bit of a challenge to describe, particularly if you do not know, or necessarily share someone's personal taste.<br \/><br \/>This is not a bad product and I can imagine a lot of people liking it more than I.  Any pickle is going to have a good deal of salt because... that's what a pickle is: something preserved in salt.  I tend to go lower on salt than most.  That said, if you like salty foods, you will like this better than I did.  I also prefer a chunkier consistency.  This pickle approaches a spread.  Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing, more a matter of personal taste.<br \/><br \/>I like the spice blend in Patak's better as well, and this is the most difficult to describe as it is subtle and noone wants to detail their recipe(and I can not think of a single ingredient which stands out).  So, all I can say is that I did not like it as much<br \/><br \/>The MTR pickle is also not as hot, and I personally like HOT.  This is a place where many people will not share my personal preference, as I know from experience that I eat food hotter than the vast majority of people (It was years before my husband could eat curries as hot as I tend to order or prepare them).<br \/>As Indian pickles go, in my experience, this is on the milder side.  Judging by the reviews I have read of several products here, *most* people will differ from my tastes in this area and probably prefer a relatively milder pickle.<br \/><br \/>All that said, this is a condiment which one would add to bring up the heat in a dish, maybe make it a little more flavorful.  I frequently have Annies frozen entrees for lunch (quick, convenient and healthy); the ones available locally being the spinach and paneer, and one or 2 bean curries with rice.  i find them fairly bland and *always* add pickle (I think without the pickle I would not enjoy them, maybe not eat them at all!).  I think the MTR mixed pickle will work OK to spice up those bland dishes.  It is not something I am going to either throw or give away, however, it is also not something I would order again.<br \/><br \/>I hope I have been able to provide a description which is adequate enough for people to decide whether or not this would be to their taste.  In sum, I found this pickle to be saltier and milder than what I am used to.  It also has a different consistency than most, being somewhat smoother and less chunky.  Again, none of these things is necessarily bad.  It is all a matter of personal taste.<br \/>Edited to note that by the time we got to the bottom of the first jar I had sussed out the ingredient which threw the taste, and my opinion off.  The heat is provided by paprika, rather than chile (which is what most or all of the other brands I have had use).  Paprika is nowhere near as hot a cayenne, or chile, and so much more is required to make this hot.  Ultimately it is not as hot, and the other flavors are somewhat diminished (because of the quantity of parika required).  if you like paprika you may like this, and if you don't, get another brand.\",\"B\":\"love it: such a great product!  it is so yummy!

It's also great to pack when I travel, since it is really hard to avoid wheat when I am eating out, and due to the hypoglycemia I have to eat meals on a regular schedule.

Science Diet seemed to be the only likley alternative. My cats liked the different size and texture of the round balls but in their infinite wisdom Frisky (the nitwits) decided there wasn't a market for the product any longer. Fat lot they know. Our three cats don't love this dental diet cat food as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.\",\"C\":\"Surprisingly wonderful: I have to start out by saying im not a big fan of Fig Newtons (or any other variety of the previous Newton cookies).

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Good Quality, But Expensive: We got the Raw Boost Bites in chicken flavor.  Although my dogs will eat anything, they were especially excited about these treats.<br \/><br \/>The quality of ingredients is excellent.  No grains--just freeze-dried meats, fruits and veggies, with some spices, and preserved with vitamin E.  They smell VERY chicken-y, moreso than conventional treats.  The freeze-drying gives these biscuits an odd texture, kind of like cardboard.  They hardly weigh anything.<br \/><br \/>While the quality is good, there are a couple of negatives.  First is the cost.  My box only contained 18 treats.  I have two big dogs, so if I gave them each three cookies\/day (not unusual), this box would last us... three days.  Second, while the size is fine for a larger dog, you'd have to break them for a smaller dog.  This makes a huge, crumbly mess.  Third, after eating one, both dogs do this weird smacking thing with their tongues for a full minute, as if part of the treat is stuck to the roof of their mouths.  I don't know if this is bothersome for them, but it drives me insane.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I'm giving this 4 stars based on the quality of ingredients, but I would not buy these because they're just not economical.

And for those of you wondering, scorched is right, crystal pepsi does taste like flat pepsi with more sugar in it, but it's AWESOME.\",\"C\":\"Un-real: Have you ever been to a nice Italian restaurant that grated real cheese right onto your dish?  Remember the wonderful aroma, taste, and texture?  Well you can buy that same cheese and enjoy a fantastic culinary experience every time you serve pasta, salad, or many other dishes.  This is not it.  Ever since discovering REAL Parmesan cheese, I will never buy this product again.<br \/><br \/>This powder-like substance is nothing like the real thing.  It has a poor aroma, flat processed taste, and doesn't even look like real cheese.  I'm not sure why it tastes so bad.  I suspect the cheese itself isn't of the quality of real imported Parmigiano to begin with, plus it's been pre-grated with added chemicals.  Sure, it adds a little flavor and adds a little light coloring to the dish, but do yourself a big favor and skip this.<br \/><br \/>Look for real Parmigiano Reggiano (I found it at my local warehouse club), or Parmigiano Reggiano Stravecchio which is aged a little more and is fantastic.  Also get a decent grater (amazon has the nice Zyliss 11370 that works great for Parmesan).  Yes it will cost about 2-3x per pound what the Kraft costs, but it is easily 100x as good.  Less will go a lot further, so you really won't spend much more for a vastly better product.  Just grating the real thing fills the room with a beautiful, addictive aroma!<br \/><br \/>Alternately, you can get a great real Romano cheese block also which is about the same price as this per pound and is also excellent grated onto pasta dishes, or even mixed with the Parmigiano for added zing.<br \/><br \/>I use both regularly.  Recently I used the Kraft stuff someone else brought to a potluck, and while it may be better than nothing, it reminded me how low American taste buds have gotten if this is the most popular grated cheese on the market.  I am reminded of when I served guests REAL maple syrup, but they didn't like it because it didn't taste like the fake stuff they were used to - artificially flavored corn syrup.  For someone like that, or who prefers cool-aid to juice, hot dogs over sirloin, etc., then like the cave dwellers in Plato's Republic, perhaps they simply cannot accept something different.  But I would hope most people do want something better!<br \/><br \/>To be fair, this will keep for a year on your shelf (unlike the real thing), so if you want it for emergency use or you are headed to Antarctica for 6 months, you might actually have a use for this powdery stuff.  If so, though, keep in mind that despite saying 100% real, this Kraft product does have added ingredients including cellulose powder and potassium sorbate (a preservative).  Other bottled brands, such as Bakers & Chefs (which I think tastes a little better than Kraft) don't have added preservatives.  Amazon also carries Racconto brand which I haven't tried.\",\"B\":\"My hair loves this stuff!: I've always been one of those people who roll their eyes when they see ads for hair products that make actual changes to your hair.

It is NOT pretty.<br \/><br \/>I did try some different products to tame the evil mass on my head, but nothing really worked, and if it did anything to the curly stuff, it made the straight stuff look like an oily mess, so I had about given up.<br \/><br \/>Fortunately this product was offered to me through Vine, and after 2 weeks of use, I am completely amazed at how different my hair looks and feels. I can't say it's the same as it was when I was young, but the curly stuff is no longer frizzy, and the straight stuff looks good too. I can wear my hair back in a ponytail again without having the sides look like crazy cat lady by afternoon.

I sincerely get a kick out of these guys. They are so simple yet so unique, and most importantly, they make my dogs happy. If you're toying with the idea of buying these, I *highly* recommend that you do. I spoil my dogs rotten and experiment with all kind of treats and toys, and these are really, really impressive. For dog and owner both.<br \/><br \/> The bigger sizes can be pricey, but I'd buy. Utterly worth it. Luckily, I have littles, and for some reason, the bitty ones are a better value. Ounce by ounce the cost is the same, but with the little ones you get several treats instead of one.<br \/><br \/>I love that, compared to virtually every other chew on the market, these things make *no mess* and have *no odor*. They are a good shape and size for handling and chewing. The small ones are heck to step on in bare feet, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.<br \/><br \/>My 12 lb papillon and 15 lb chunky dachshund can get a nice firm grip on a chew and spend a pleasant afternoon with it and there will still be enough for another go. I do take them away when they reach choking-hazard size, and I wish I didn't have to, but I get nervous. They are rocks, after all. But they don't go to waste: I save them up to give to my uncle's 4 pound mini Yorkie, because then they're normal-sized for her teeny mouth.<br \/><br \/>These treats are fun to tell your friends about. Doesn't Himalayan Dog Chew sound impressive? Far classier than pizzle sticks! Those things are the antithesis of these elegant treats.<br \/><br \/>I call them cheese as in Do you want your cheese? Where's your cheese? Quit burying your cheese in my pillow.<br \/><br \/>Finally, and this is important, regarding my toothless wonder reference in my title:<br \/><br \/>The papillon, Gigi, is missing a whopping 9 teeth. (Side note: Little dogs are at great risk for dental problems; get their teeth cleaned yearly!) She gamely tries to enjoy other chew treats, with some measure of success. But these are perfect for her, because she can just gum one kinda like a zwieback and get all the maximum goodness. If you have a dog missing teeth, they can get real pleasure out of these. The action of chewing combined with yumminess. It's a special joy to see her loving it.<br \/><br \/>Gigi's my miracle dog. She's been paralyzed twice, had seizures, pneumonia, been bitten by a Brown Recluse, and has congestive heart disease. To see her settle down with a Himalayan Dog Chew and enjoy one of life's simple pleasures is one of *my* life's simple pleasures. Now you know why I spoil them.\",\"C\":\"Perfect: I needed these for my mothers wedding cake and was rather worried because she moved the date up on me but these were perfect.

Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required.

On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors.

Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br \/><br \/>In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to.

Clark also manufactured chewing gum and in 1921 incorporated the Clark Brothers Chewing Gum Company, makers of Teaberry and Tendermint. However, by 1931, the candy bar business had grown so large that Clark decided to specialize exclusively in candy bars.<br \/><br \/>In 1955, the Clark family sold their candy business to the Beatrice Food Company, which operated the company until 1983.<br \/><br \/>In 1983, Leaf, Inc., which operated 11 candy and gum plants in the United States, acquired the confectionery division of Beatrice foods, including Clark.

Clark became part of the Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company. After a period of financial instability, the company was again sold in June of 1995.

The milk is GOD SENT for babies with sensitive tummies, who cannot take cow milk and\/or soy. My 3-months old daughter had reflux, high acid level in her tummy, colics, gas and constipation varying with diarrhea. My husband and I are both foreign residents in Switzerland and I have to say that Swiss formula market is apolling in terms of choice, and useless doctors just kept medicating her instead of changing the cow milk formula to something more appropriate, just gave her more and more different drugs which only added to the problem. At some point she was crying all day long for several days!! I stopped listening to the doctors and did some online research- tried soy milk formula and lactose free formula (both Nestle), no changes. I tried all 3-4 cow milk formulas available on the Swiss market (Adapta, Holle, Milupa, Nestle) - no changes!<br \/>Finally I found a can of Meyenberg goat powder milk in the house, which I had bought previously for my organic cosmetics hobby- and gave it a try in a pure desperation. WHAT A CHANGE! She is like a different baby. ALL PROBLEMS GONE INSTANTLY- on the same day. I took the baby off all the medications these so-called specialists were overmedicating her with ( I am changing the pediatrician as well), and she feels perfect and is happier than I've ever seen her. I am stashing up with this milk now for a long time, as no Meyenberg milk is sold locally. Would highly recommend this product to all parents looking for a healthy  solution for their babies- goat milk protein is much easier to digest by small tummies. Furthermore, historically, long before any commercial baby formulas were invented, goat milk (and NOT cow milk!!! soy was not even on the menu) was used for centuries to feed babies by mothers who could not breastfeed. Today, when everything is Marketing-driven and cow milk manufacturers are dominating the market, this fact is totally forgotten, and all of a sudden other products are advertised to be appropriate (on top of that commercial brands stuff their formulas with all sorts of ingredients and chemicals their imagination can come up with- no matter if good for babies or not). The Meyenberg goat milk has few, simple ingredients which do not overwhelm small tummies, it is fantastically nutricious, natural and tasty. My daughter cannot get enough of it- I never saw her having such a healthy appetite towards any other milk she was given.<br \/><br \/>The only request to the seller (the Vitamine Shoppe - actually one of the most professional sellers on Amazon)- please please please speed up your order processing! Although it arrived earlier than estimated (7 days instead of estimated 9 days after the order was placed), but the order processing itself took 5 days before it was actually shipped by expedited shipping. This is far too long, if the baby cannot eat anything else. If you could process orders faster- it would help a lot!<br \/>Thank you very much for shipping this product to Switzerland anyway (I think it is almost the only reliable seller who does)- it's a life savior.\",\"B\":\"Wonderful Oil: This hazelnut oil is wonderful and a great value as well.

It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br \/><br \/>Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br \/><br \/>Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.

I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea leaves range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1\/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0010NR7C0>Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass<\/a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

I have made these with an old, traditional square grid waffle iron, a light-weight circular Belgium waffle maker, and a light-weight flip Belgium waffle maker, and the results were completely ordinary.  It's only after I purchased a heavier-duty flip Belgium style maker did the waffles come out gloriously light, fluffy, with a slight crispy outside:  just perfect for me.<br \/><br \/>The results are also dependent on exactly how thick the batter comes out which depends on the size of the eggs used and on how precisely the water is measured out.  I prefer the waffles when the batter is on the runny side.  When you fill the waffle maker, a runny batter spreads quite quickly and you actually don't use as much batter per waffle.  You can still see the black parts of the insides of the grids of the waffle maker poking through the batter when you go to close the maker.  The waffles then really expand as they cook and you get a very light, fluffy waffle with a crispy outside.  Yum!\"}}"},

I like the 'no MSG' aspect, because MSG gives me a headache (always has), and there are some I've seen that do have MSG in them, so it's nice to know these don't. When compared to other snacks, like chips or cookies, wasabi peas offer a kick pick-me-up snack that's much more healthful for you. Dr. Oz even said on one of his shows that they help boost metabolism, so you can't beat that! My son will even eat these peas, and he doesn't like anything green!<br \/><br \/>These came in a bag, but it was the crinkly type of bag, that was stiff and it broke and tore, so the bag opened and spilled peas out.

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.\",\"B\":\"Brilliant: I love this gum! I'm not a gum person - normally I never chew gum.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br \/><br \/>Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br \/>Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs\/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

It is just slightly sweet, but not too much.  It will work well for breakfast or for a snack right out of the box.  The cereal has a satisfying crunch too.<br \/><br \/>One of the negative reviews noted that the cereal contains artificial coloring (Yellow 5 and Yellow 6).  I too am puzzled why Quaker would want to color the cereal, and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I suppose some marketing genius didn't like the color.  But Quaker oatmeal doesn't have coloring, and people buy plenty of that.  I hope that in the future Quaker worries more about how its products taste and less about how they look.\",\"C\":\"Bad gas and constipation: This formula gave my baby constant gas and constipation.

At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br \/><br \/>Sincerely,<br \/><br \/>  \u00a7 homiedog \u00a7\",\"C\":\"My finicky dog actually likes these!: My dog, Sara, is very particular about her food and treats.  She will only eat high quality canned foods and 100% meat treats.  She turns her nose up at any food or treat that she finds of inferior quality so when I purchased these Buffalo Bully Sticks I half expected her to toss them on the floor and ignore them, which she actually did at first.  But later I caught her chewing on one and she was enjoying it so much that she kept at it until she had half of it a mushy mess. She still hasn't finished the first one, but as she is a small dog I don't expect her to anytime soon.  I'm just happy that she keeps coming back to it and seems to enjoy working on it from time to time.\",\"B\":\"A BIG **** Five Way *****: As a former Cincinnatian, short a special trip to Cincinnati, this is a wonderful alternative. I used it when I lived in Cincy ... and now in CA.  I use it here for theme dinners (both the spaghetti and a chili dog) with friends ... always a hit.  I suggest adding less water initially or reducing the amount of water via extended simmering.  The former maybe a better approach so less gas or electricity is used.\"}}"},

You could use this either for lunch or dinner. One distinct feature of this product is that it comes with individual units containing the fresh mixers that can be mixed prior to heating. Storage is easy since this does not need refrigeration. Just add water to the pasta, snap on the lid, cook (microwave) for a three minutes, drain the water, add the sauce (from sauce pack) and cook for one minute and enjoy a hot meal. I did not like the Ziti and meat sauce, but if you like meat sauce, this is for you. Other sauces available are; Sesame Teriyaki Chicken, Southwestern Style Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken (see Healthy Choice website). If you have precooked vegetables sitting in the fridge this is the time to use. I would use; cheese (personal favorites are Parmesan or cheddar), broccoli, Bell peppers, garlic, Zucchini squash, or mushrooms, I would recommend combining these with your sauce while heating the mixture. Use your imagination to add or substitute any of the veggies recommended. I liked the ease of the preparation and the separate units containing the sauce for ready mixing with cooked pasta.

I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.\",\"C\":\"Great for adults, too!: I tried this product because it was a Friday Special and it caught my eye it being 100% fruit and 100% organic.

I buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before I can eat it all.  I bought the banana mish mash also, and really like it, too.  I like to add it to my oatmeal, or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast, or just by itself!  To clarify the ingredients- it has 3 different fruits, not just peach and not just banana.  Obviously, I'm ok with this...just wanted to throw that out there.  There are multiple things I love about this product.
