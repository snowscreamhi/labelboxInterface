It's important to keep aside special treats and toys that are only used for important training moments - when you MUST have your dog's attention.  Trader Joe's cheapo brand for getting him to sit, MilkBone for when he responds to a Come command and Paul Newman treats to distract him when he meets other dogs.  My dog hates boxers for some reason.  The first night after we adopted him, he attacked my neighbor's Boxer in the hallway as my neighbors returned from a vet hospital visit - it was awful.  About a week later we had the dogs meet again - this time outside on neutral territory.  We made sure they met at a perpendicular, rather than head on, to minimize the chance of conflict.  My dog loves these treats so much that he didn't pay any attention to my neighbor's dog as she sniffed him.  We gave both dogs treats and brought them closer, praising each of them for good behavior and correcting any aggressive behavior immediately.  The Boxer was given her favorite squeak toy in addition to some of these treats and all ended well.  I always carry these treats on walks just in case I see another dog.  These are high quality, healthy, and my dog loves them - he jumps up and down every time he sees me grab the bag.  I don't just hand these out - these treats command attention and are reserved for exceptional behavior and when I need laser focus from my dog!\",\"C\":\"The quintessential breakfast tea.:\n Given this blend's orgin, the name English Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name breakfast tea. It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word English, which has been part of its name ever since.<br \/><br \/>English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday work horse, and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.\",\"A_id\":559885,\"B_id\":421858,\"C_id\":18602}}"},

Imagine my pleased surprise when I mentioned this in a review and they responded to let me know they were releasing new flavors soon and encouraging me to keep trying new ones and keep reviewing! I know they read all reviews posted and I've received wonderfully kind responses to my reviews and emails to them. Their customer service is stellar and it makes it so that I want to recommend their teas to everyone I meet (and I do!). And while yes, I have gotten a ton of matcha through this promotion, I've also gained an adoration of matcha that will keep me coming to them long after I really do stop reviewing their product. But by now they know me, and they know my reviews and they're just wonderfully kind to me. When I received my package yesterday, I found a little matcha spoon included with my order! I don't know if it's a promotion I just didn't see, or if it was for me specially, but it certainly made my day!<br \/><br \/>I don't know an awful lot about English toffee, but what I do know, I like. I got this one to try with my wife, in an effort to get her to like matcha. We'll see how it goes!<br \/><br \/>When I opened the package, it smelled a lot like the Caramel Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, which is very promising. I love their Caramel matcha. Brewed up, it still smelled like caramel, but with a hint of chocolate. And that's exactly what it tastes like, caramel mixed together with tasty, tasty chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is very, very good. Very sweet too, but not overwhelmingly so. But then again, I like my teas sweet. But when I see pictures of English Toffee, this is what I think it would taste like, so yay! I love that it even tastes like that crunchy caramel....mmm.

It didn't occur to me at first that it could be at all related to the new Stevia. Then my toddler started telling me he was itchy all over. Then I got my menstrual cycle 2 weeks early. Finally it dawned on me that it could be related to the Stevia since this was the only thing at all that had changed in our diets. I googled 'adverse reactions to Stevia' and found several webpages where people described symptoms identical to mine. I was truly shocked. I stopped the Stevia... all the symptoms went away almost immediately. I realize now that there is a difference between the flavored liquid Stevia, which contains a 'proprietary blend' and 'natural flavors' (which could mean anything) and just the straight powder with nothing added (I haven't tried that, but won't now.) It also occurs to me that maybe the only Stevia that can truly be considered historically safe is the actual leaf itself, straight off the plant out of the garden. I still believe Stevia's safety record in the countries where it originated, but I think something has probably been lost in translation with the processing of it here in the US. Just my opinion. It should also be noted that anyone with allergies to ragweed should not take Stevia because it can cause asthma attacks. Hope this helps someone.\",\"A_id\":169340,\"B_id\":280892,\"C_id\":149602}}"},

(or breves)<br \/>2) not much crema - what there is seems to disappear pretty quickly<br \/>3) it is quite a bit harder to close my machine with the Ethical capsule in place, however, you have to be impressed with a company willing to replace your machine if their capsules damage it.<br \/>4) These capsules are not individually sealed, so you need to consume the 10 capsules within a short period of time, or you'll be drinking stale coffee.<br \/><br \/>If you need\/want to save the money, this capsule does that without really sacrificing too much, as long as you drink at least 3 a day, otherwise, that coffee is getting pretty darn stale by the fourth day.<br \/><br \/>Edit: Ok I've drunk about 15 of these things, and when I saw the new low price, I popped for more. I like to drink a lot of espresso, these are good enough to allow me to feed the habit, without wincing. I've got the empty caps coming - can't wait to see how those work, I have a LOT of Illy left that I bought for my EC155 that died on me. RIP (2nd one) I have high hopes for the fill-able caps.<br \/><br \/>Edit 2 - ok, the necaps came and though they are relatively tricky, I'm hoping I've hit the right combo of coffee\/tamping, however the one thing they showed me is that Illy in a necap is better than the cremosa in a capsule I don't have to pack myself, etc.<br \/><br \/>Edit 3 - now I've had at least 150 of these (I mentioned I drink a lot of espresso) I will not buy them again. Maybe MAYBE if they went down to the super ultra cheap price they were before, but at $25 there's no way I'm buying them.

It's just been so darn inexpensive, and since I drink all my espresso as a breve - well, it' works fine for me. I did start to poke extra holes in the cap (thanks to someone else's review) I just put the cap face down on the counter and take a paring knife and poke a hole (it's easy) and twist the knife a little to open the hole. I also have a serving fork that I use the tine to do the same thing. Then I pop it in the machine. I think because the capsule is not aluminum the hole the punch makes is not wide enough to let the proper water flow through. My experience punching the extra holes has been a richer deeper flavor in the resulting espresso. Try it. :)\",\"A_id\":385877,\"B_id\":523998,\"C_id\":462019}}"},

My large dogs find the invidual snaps incredibly tasty.  At first my dog tated it, spit it out, then tasted it and spit it out again.  But soon thereafter she would quickly run to her biscuit spot and happily munch away.  I like the fact that they have added ingredients to help with joint issues.  Although the individual snaps are small in size, they are crunchy enough that the dog thinks it is getting a full size bone, I don't know how Canidae does it.<br \/><br \/>I just ordered a 4lb box.\",\"B\":\"Please understand what it means to go grain free.....:\n This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br \/><br \/>Cost<br \/>All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br \/><br \/>Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br \/><br \/>Smell<br \/>Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br \/><br \/>Taste<br \/>Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br \/><br \/>Poop<br \/>When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the Whole 30 and see what I mean.<br \/><br \/>Switching to Grain Free<br \/>Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br \/><br \/>BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.\",\"C\":\"Greenies for my dog:\n I have used them for years.

The flavors sounded very appealing.<br \/><br \/>Reality couldn't be farther removed from the picture. The cupcakes were practically inedible. The chemical flavor of the additives was unbearable.

I ended up throwing everything away, and having to buy something else in a hurry.<br \/><br \/>Furthermore, I'm not someone who likes much frosting on cupcakes, but the package provided barely made enough to thinly cover the cupcakes. Very thinly. If you were to put as much frosting on your cupcake as is shown in the picture, about a third of your frosting would already be used up. This is probably a good thing, since the frosting had that horrible quality of coating the roof of your mouth in a layer of revolting grease that is hard to get rid of.

The only problem is that some like it really hot and spicy while others prefer it medium or mild.  It's hard to please everyone and just adding hot sauce at the end isn't the same since the peppers and spices don't get a chance to become a part of dish as it does when it simmers for a long while.  With Rasta Fire and a little extra work everyone gets what they want.<br \/><br \/>I often separate my curry dishes before I add the meat (for my son the vegetarian), now I just separate some more for those that like it hot.  I love hot sauce and have a dozen bottles open in the fridge at any one time.  I gave this sauce a chance several years ago based on the ingredient list.  The tropical fruits such as orange, pineapple and papaya and the spices that includes curry, tumeric, cumin allspice and annato really appealed to me.  I would rate the heat as 6 or 7 out of 10, just hot enough to hold it's own in a stew but not so hot that the flavor is over-powered by the heat.  The combination of heat, tropical spices and fruit make for a sweet and savory sauce.  Here are a few things that I've used it in (or on):<br \/><br \/>*  Indian Dishes<br \/>*  Thai Dishes<br \/>*  Bar-b-Qued Ribs<br \/>*  Deviled Eggs<br \/>*  Chicken Wings<br \/>*  Burgers<br \/>*  As a topping for cream cheese or goat cheese appetizers<br \/>*  As a marinade (with orange or pineapple juice)<br \/><br \/>I really like this sauce and always have a bottle on hand.  If you think that all Habanero sauces are so hot that they hurt, you might want to give this a try. It's really surprising how complex the taste is.\",\"A_id\":80206,\"B_id\":560948,\"C_id\":120994}}"},

There's no difference between Omahas chicken breasts and regular chicken breasts I can buy in any grocery store Save a lot\/Aldi included....for well over 1\/2 the price of what they charge for these and for nearly quadruple the amount. So, why charge so much for these? I can get behind their steaks, even though they're overpriced too, and a few other Omaha products like the hot dogs and stuffed baked potatoes, but can't really get behind these chicken breasts. It's not like these are organic chicken breasts that have a decent size to them, which is what the price Omaha charges for them would suggest. These are as generic as generic gets. Would of been fine if 1 of their chicken breasts was the size of 2 of their chicken breasts. Instead it's like they got 1 large chicken breast and cut it it up to make 4 out of it. Luckily, I received these in a comped sampler. There's no reason whatsoever for anyone to buy just these chicken breasts through Omaha Steaks as Omaha gives you no reason to. Omaha really needs to make their portions bigger. People would be fine paying their prices if the portions were bigger...but half the things they sell the price to size ratio leaves you feeling ripped off. Not that I paid for these as like I said they were comped, but if I did no doubt I'd feel pretty ripped off. Change your mentality Omaha. Instead of less is more, think MORE is MORE.

Of course, a lot of people don't live anywhere near a Costco, but the branded items are still easily available online.<br \/><br \/>Yesterday, I picked up a big bag (3 pounds or 48 ounces) of almonds. The almonds are fresh and tasty and unsalted. I actually, prefer salted nuts, but I'm also trying to cut the intake of salt so it's good to find these unsalted ones. The quality is excellent. About the only negative I can note is that the bag doesn't hold up well after being opened so I'll have to transfer the contents to a large zip-lock bag to attempt to maintain freshness.

Those that weren't, he complained that it wasn't good because it wasn't heinz. Even when his father, perhaps the best grillsman I have ever met, made burgers, they were insufficient to my husband. It became a quest to get him to eat one of his favorite foods (and to stop complaining). I searched. And searched. And searched.

Why does Zevia company have to invent their own holistic, all-natural recipe for root beer to create a soda with Stevia, why couldn't Zevia have just bought the exact formula from A&W and used Stevia as the sweetener instead?  That soda would taste great.  Unfortunately, this Zevia soda doesn't taste like normal root bear or even diet root beer.  It has a weak taste that's strange and unfamiliar, followed by the harsh aftertaste bite of the oils and ginger making me worry they're covering a weaker, unpleasant aftertaste from either the stevia or other ingredients in the zevia all-natural formula.  Bleh.  If you want guilt-free soda, but dont care about going all-natural, like I don't care, this is not the soda line for you.  Hopefully the diet soda giants will break out a stevia-sweetened branch of their regular line, as Zevia isn't tasty enough to switch.

So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br \/><br \/>It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br \/><br \/>In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br \/><br \/>My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet.

However, given the rats on meth pace of our lives these days, we don't always have time to eat properly or prepare healthy meals. In that case we need to pick the healthiest convenience foods we can.<br \/><br \/>Wolfgang Puck is a famous chef and his line of foods includes some organic (only USDA Organic; a weak standard, but better than nothing) foods like this.<br \/><br \/>Taste-wise, I found it very good, although much better with some organic butter added. The low-fat nonsense that has poisoned us for decades takes its toll on taste as well as health. One finds people adding more salt or even MSG in the absence of real flavor, which is mostly in the fat. (Hmmmm, oh, well, no time to go into a rant here.) Which is not to say this is billed as a low fat soup.<br \/><br \/>Most of the ingredients listed are organic (USDA), and there are only a couple of questionable entries. One finds spice extractives, natural flavor, and organic spice all listed, and all of these can be code words for MSG. MSG can legally be called a dozen different such things, and while they might also be part of a secret recipe, it raises the specter of doubt. That could also contribute to the sodium content, which is over 1.4 grams in the entire can (supposedly two servings - I find it more like one). If I could be sure there was no MSG in it, I would rate it higher.<br \/><br \/>Still, it is far better than your run-of-the-mill non-organic soup, and I keep it around for those times when a quick bowl of warm chicken soup is just what one needs.

I've gone through many boxes, and the bars are consistent in quality and always fresh.<br \/><br \/>I'm knocking off one star because the photo on the box is very misleading.  The bars have nowhere near the amount of filling shown on the photo the box.  In fact, the difference is significant enough that I would say that the photo bears little resemblance to the actual product.  I've attached my own photo up top to show what the inside of the bar actually looks like.  I would estimate the filling actually makes up about 20% - 25% of the bar, whereas the box photo seems to show around 80% - 85% filling.\",\"A_id\":398813,\"B_id\":513599,\"C_id\":520348}}"},

It leaves no mess in the kettle at all.  When it starts to pop the first kernels that come out are the best coated ones and then as more pop they get less coated, but if you mix them all together I think you get great flavor.

The price was great, the ingredients were great, so I ordered it. I still had some Blue Buffalo left so I kept it in one bowl and put Natural Balance in another bowl.

It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br \/><br \/>1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br \/><br \/>2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br \/><br \/>3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br \/><br \/>There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br \/><br \/>All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br \/><br \/>As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br \/><br \/>Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.

The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br \/><br \/>The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"excellent coffee:\n We are snowbirding in the US south and I was thrilled to discover that I could get Tim's coffee through Amazon, as we couldn't bring enough with us to last the whole winter.  This coffee is great and the service from Amazon was very good - the delivery was prompt and the coffee was the same price as we would pay for it in Canada at a Tim's outlet.\",\"B\":\"Could be better:\n I bought several case of it, thinking my little baby girl will like it.  Nope, she does not like it mixed with water or milk.  It does not mix well with soup.  Since it has a mild sweet taste to it, it will ruin the flavor of the soup.  She is picky, what can I say.<br \/><br \/>Finally, after many tries, we finally figured out a way to feed her the cereal:  mix the cereal with formula\/milk; pour into a pan and warm it up on the stove; while heating it up, stir constantly to ensure they are mixed together; once well mixed, let it cool and then pour into bottle to feed.  I had to cut the silicone nipple in order to accommodate the thick liquid.<br \/><br \/>We feed her this mix once or twice daily.  As she grows, formula\/milk alone do not last as long as they used to.  To keep her stomach content, night time feeding is essential, so she does not awake from hunger in the middle of the night.  A bit of work, but I think it is worth it.\",\"C\":\"Hope this is helpful:\n I initially had a hard time getting a good and consistant cup of coffee from the EZ cup.  To be honeset, I didn't buy the EZ cup because it was ecofriendly, or even because it would cost less per cup.  I bought it because I love a good cup of coffee.  They are few and far between when using K-cups, and even with all of the blends available in K-cups, there were some I liked that I still just couldn't get. I wanted this to wok, so I followed another reviewer's recommendations and cut the bottom off of a K-cup.  This was to slow the flow of coffe through the device. Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't find that a 3\/8 disk did anything, so I experimented. I wound up with a plastic disk that was cut just inside the protruding rim that you find on the bottom of each K-cup.  It seems to slow the flow enough to strengthen the brew.  I also used 2 TBSP of coffee per cup.  I am getting a great consistant cup of coffee.  I can make it allot stronger which is one of the reasons that I have a problem with K-cups.  I used the EZ cup filter with fresh ground coffee.  I agree that the EZ Cup spring tamps down the coffee and it seems to work better with more coffee and the plastic K-cup disk. Now I finally can get a strong cup of coffee regardless of whether a dark or lighter roast. I really think this has made the difference between a convenient coffee maker with mediocre coffee and a great cup of coffee.  I hope you find this review helpful.\",\"A_id\":477000,\"B_id\":505470,\"C_id\":348762}}"},

Originally we had thought we'd get our own oil and save money rather than use the pre-portioned packs. However we tried it once and could never go back. It's just so easy and delicious that it's worth any extra expense. We went on the auto-ship program to save some money. I highly recommend this popcorn. It's actually ruined us on movie theater popcorn since we actually prefer this.\",\"C\":\"great for egg\/dairy allergies:\n I'm allergic to dairy and egg. I've been using tofu for many years in no-egg egg salad (use regular egg salad recipe, just use mashed tofu instead of chopped egg) and dips and puddings. For no-egg egg salad, you can just use a fork to mash it up. Let it chill an hour or two for best flavor.<br \/><br \/>For dips - just use any dip recipe or mix. A box of Mori-Nu will work fine for a mix envelope, just blend until creamy (and the silken-style extra firm type does cream up well this way, if you want something all-purpose) and add some oil and lemon or lime juice to substitute for sour cream. If you want, you can follow instructions and actually slowly pour the oil in while blending, but just dumping it in works also. You can try without oil if you want, but I like the oil. Let it chill for at least an hour or so. If you think the flavor is too intense, you can just use part of another package to get the volume you want, but nobody's ever complained about the 12 oz box method.<br \/><br \/>The consistency of tofu is great for really instant pudding from any junky pudding mix you like (who says tofu has to be healthy?!?) or your own recipe for whatever you usually add to milk to make pudding. I look for mixes that don't have dairy myself. If desperate, I'll look for recipes... But all you really need to do is blend the tofu with the mix and voil&agrave; -  it's pudding. Chill for a while, but it tastes pretty good even just out of the blender. Don't know how well it freezes for pudding pops, haven't tried, but I've seen a recipe for tofu fudgsicles based on a tofu chocolate mousse recipe (using firm or extra firm silken tofu, as is available here), so it probably works fine. You might need to add some sweetener to taste if you don't think it's decadent enough. This is much easier than trying to make soy milk work...<br \/><br \/>Thin strips of tofu cooked in a pan  with soy sauce (or baked with any sauce) are pretty good also if you're into cooking. Tofu soaks up whatever flavors you toss at it, given sufficient time and encouragement. The instructions I have for baking are to bake for 30 min until firm but not tough, turning half way through, but I've only personally tried the pan method. I've seen recipes for veggie bacon using tofu and nutritional yeast (such as Red Star), liquid smoke, and oil.<br \/><br \/>You also can use tofu as the base for quick ice cream, just mix the box with frozen fruit, sweetener to taste, and blend. It can be used for regular smoothies also, of course. Look for recipes at vegan hangouts for both fancier ice cream recipes (often combining with soy milk, although I wonder if coconut milk would work well) and smoothie recipes.<br \/><br \/>There are also recipes for pumpkin pie using blended tofu instead of dairy. You might need to add some oil to fatten up the tofu a bit.<br \/><br \/>The Mori-Nu boxes are really handy since they don't take up refrigerator space and can be always available. The case price is much, much cheaper than at my local grocery store for individual boxes. I just wish Amazon would give an expiration date for current stock (or at least a no-earlier-than expiration date), as some other sources are now doing.\",\"A_id\":12267,\"B_id\":364653,\"C_id\":161159}}"},

I used to struggle with sugar cravings. I've found over the years that if I implement a relatively low carb diet by completely avoiding most sugar-laden items, I have no cravings whatsoever. This discovery has allowed me to lose a lot of weight. It has also made me lose my sweet tooth. These bars are perfect for me because they don't taste that sweet and because they don't trigger those old sugar cravings. For some reason, Larabars bring back those old sugar cravings. When I get a box of Larabars, they call to me all the time (those of you with cravings will know exactly what I mean). But with Raw Revolution bars, I can enjoy one without having a craving that makes me want to grab another right away.<br \/><br \/>If you like the taste of really dark chocolate that isn't all that sweet and if you like coconut, you'll probably like this bar.

Then I use the second bag for the shells from the third bag, and so on.  The trouble is what to do with the shells from the first bag?  I thought about it and put the shells from the first bag I enjoyed into a candy jar, to save until I finish enjoying the twelfth bag, which I will then fill with the shells from the first bag, which are now in my candy jar.  The bags are very colorful and air-tight, which can cause mildew if the shells are moist.  So if you are going to save the bags of empty shells I recommend that you split the shells with a tiny nut-cracker (or needle-nose pliers) which is what I have always done after an unfortunate experience some time back with mildew in the bags.  Don't split them in your mouth or they will become moist and then you have to dry them in your oven set to low heat (I don't have an oven!).  If you can't afford a fancy Japanese pillow filled with oat-husks for your posture, the bags of sunflower seed shells make a great substitute.  While I definitely CAN afford the Japanese oat-husk pillows (I'm a PROFESSIONAL person) I think the David bags add a lot of color to my bedroom, plus the waterproof plastic doesn't absorb my night-sweat (avoids more mildew).  My group and I discussed theories about which David these seeds are named for, it would be nice if the company would put a picture of the right David on the bag so we would stop arguing.  Other than that, this is the perfect food, the perfect product.  Put a picture of whoever David is on the bag and I will give you a fifth star!

This means the sea kelp soaked seeds were placed in a Master Sprouter tray or a tray from my old Fresh Life electric sprouter, covered with a the vented lid from the mesh I had bought at Jo-Ann's crafts, wetted with sea kelp spray, put in the dark, misted or lightly sprayed with tap water or sea kelp mixture 2 times a day until the green shoots appeared and then put on a kitchen shelf near a window to continue to grow to 7 inches and green up. Germination rate was so low, it was not worth repeating. Kitchen temperature is about 78 degrees.<br \/><br \/>Since then I have switched to an organic soil, vermiculate, perlite mix. Using about 1 inch of soil in the Master Sprouter trays (Sproutpeople.com) and following the same process as above, the germination rate is excellent. Thick crop, very green.

If so, then the organic label of the seeds may be in question. In previous years, when I used non-organic wheat berries from Whole Foods Market on a whim, the white and green mold was fairly thick.

Both of those brands have an amazing soft texture and don't have to sit there chewing forever as you do with the Welch's.\",\"B\":\"healthy snacks:\n well my dogs love carrots so they dont have a problem snacking healthy but when it comes to healthy meaty snacks most have wheat or meals (meal is just filler). i am so glad i discovered zukes with natural heathy ingredients no filler!! awesome product for you pooches!! highly reccomend you give these a shot, well worth the price.\",\"C\":\"I went looking for a tea pot .. and found this gem:\n I had no idea what to expect when I purchased this item. I was looking for a nice tea pot and strainer combo. I figured I'd give it a shot for the price. I was in for a surprise. What a joy to the eye, soul, and palate.<br \/><br \/>Now, if you are looking for a large, sturdy tea pot - keep looking. This is a very delicate, small, 16 oz pot. I didn't get a strainer. No big deal. I don't need another one. What I did get for this tiny price is the most remarkable visual and sensory experience that lifts my soul after a long, hard, stressful day at work. From the moment I opened the Amazon box and saw the lovely bamboo box, I was sold. Then when I opened the box and found the tea in a mini bamboo box, I was very pleased. How beautiful is this presentation!<br \/><br \/>When the tea blooms in the pot, it is a beautiful site to see. The small tea pot then makes sense. The size and rounded body are the perfect showcase for this unusual product. Besides, it is the perfect fit for my large glass latte cup. I've had no problem pouring the tea, and my lid fits perfectly. It is delicate, so I am extra careful.<br \/><br \/>I've had no problem with the tea blooming using boiling water. I temper it with a metal spoon as a pour it into the pot. I don't want to chance cracking the tea pot. The tea tastes delicate and delicious. I get 3 pots from each bloom. I like my tea strong, so I brew it longer than recommended, but it never gets bitter. The second pot tastes best to me, but the 3rd pot is still excellent. And the colors of the brewed tea are beautiful also. They seems to glimmer with multiple hues. Don't ask me how or why.<br \/><br \/>I will be reordering this tea! You can't put a price on the relaxation I get from this experience. As a matter of fact, I'll be ordering a second gift set for myself - my boyfriend and I are fighting over who gets to keep the bamboo box! Besides, if this pot breaks, I want a back up.\",\"A_id\":107097,\"B_id\":516511,\"C_id\":458574}}"},

The ingredients are excellent, and being freeze-dried, have a good shelf life compared to some soft treats. Also important to me is they are made in the USA. I'm refusing to buy treats made in China as many dog treats are. Just too many unanswered questions.<br \/><br \/>Most important of course is whether my dog likes them. Now, my dog is not very picky, but he definitely reacts with more enthusiasm in training according to how much he likes the treat being used. And boy, does he LOVE these!

After getting used to the flavors a bit more, I decided 3-stars was more appropriate.<br \/><br \/>I love tea samplers, trying all these different flavors, typically there are a couple I don't care for and a couple I love. No so with the Chanakara sampler: I didn't like a single flavor.<br \/><br \/>These are caffeine-free herbal teas that have more of a purpose than just being warm and tasting good; each flavor supposedly gives you some benefit. The strength of that benefit undoubtedly varies according to the person (I didn't notice anything).<br \/><br \/>Each tea is packaged in nice two-colored package, telling what that tea is good for. On the tea box it has all the flavors, as well as a chakra chart telling you briefly about the 7 chakras. Each tea bag has the number corresponding to that chakra. (That was pretty interesting.)<br \/><br \/>Missing from the box and the individual tea packages was any kind of brew time. I normally ignore brew times anyway, but I thought in this case perhaps I was brewing it incorrectly... I guess not. From watered-down to a cup of hot liquid seeped for 5 minutes, no matter the level of sweetener, I did not like these teas.<br \/>The tag on some of the tea bags just says `Chanakara for Mind, Body & Spirit' rather than telling you the type of tea.<br \/><br \/>Red Berry Rooibos, an herbal tea for health & prosperity (Ingredients: Organic rooibos, rosehips, hibiscus, raspberry leaf, ova urea, citric acid, and natural strawberry flavor). I had this tea when I was sick. Didn't smell very good. Tastes like preserved strawberries, but weak. More sweetener didn't give it more flavor. On the other hand (when not sick), drinking it with dried mango made a good breakfast.<br \/>Vanilla Honeybush, an herbal tea for gathering strength & power (Organic honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor). The tea bag smelled really nice, like a dessert, but the taste is icky. Almost like watered-down liquid cheerios.<br \/>White Lotus, an herbal tea for meditation & wisdom (Chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus flowers, lotus flavor, and linden flowers). The tea bag did not smell good, but the tea smelled and tasted mostly like Chrysanthemum tea, and a bit like chamomile. It takes some getting used to, then it's not bad.<br \/>Melon & Green Tea, a tea for love & harmony (Organic green tea, orange peel, jerboa mate and natural melon flavor). Didn't smell very good. If you put a lot of sweetener it doesn't taste bad... but it doesn't taste good. Very dry.<br \/>Dragonfruit, an herbal tea for passion and creativity (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint and natural dragonfruit flavor). If you've ever tasted a dragonfruit, you may find this to be not far off... it's not very good. Let it sit longer and it's OK.<br \/>Guanabana, an herbal tea for imagination & insight (Orange peel, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, eyebright, bilberry, licorice powder, vegetable juice for color and natural guanabana flavor). It's palatable, but not good.<br \/><br \/>So, sadly, I didn't like a single flavor. I've enjoyed samplers such as <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000CQBZRE>Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler<\/a> and <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000CQID92>Stash Premium Herbal Tea Sampler<\/a>, which I recommend in lieu of the Chanakara tea.\",\"B\":\"Easy and delicious:\n I have bought these bars for years, but when I was no longer able to find them locally - I tried on Amazon!

In any event, it beats buying some of the bulk chia seeds I have found at local stores with little or no explanation of where the seeds really come from.<br \/><br \/>In all, I find chia seeds rather tasteless.

I have noticed improvement in my overall health since eating them, but I can't say for sure if chia played any role in that because I changed my diet in many other ways and greatly increased my work out schedule.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br \/>Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br \/><br \/>Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br \/>Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs\/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

It is tiny and printed in white on a yellow background. I had to go to the Kashi website to find a readable list.<br \/><br \/>It's not all bad. Kashi's signature seven whole grains and sesame are in these bars. Canola oil? Well, some say that's not good for you.

I opened it and tried it and unless we got a dud, real 'Fresh' mango when peeled cut into chunks and pureed will be a bright yellow or bright orange color, not a brownish color which is what this 'fresh' mango puree was. I am a real mango lover and personally feel this color and taste is what an over ripened mango that is going bad will look and taste like. After reading all the reviews i was disappointed, and my baby only had a teaspoon and didn't know any different since it was her first fruit. Also can you really classify something as 'fresh' when it can sit in it's packaging for a whole year? IMO the lure of this and similarly packaged products is basically the design of the packaging and the products easy accessability. As others say you can eat it on the go, while traveling and anywhere basically and the child can hold it, it doesn't create a mess, bpa free packaging easy all around. Other then that once opened it's only good for a day or 2 like a real fresh cut mango is anyway, only its not really 'fresh'..but since here on the northeast mangos only come around a few months out of the year and since most people don't have the time to puree their own fruits and veggies, these types of products are the only alternative, otherwise cubing and pureeing your own mango..now that's fresh mango! Hopefully i can find the time to start pureeing soon. Edit: tried another pouch and it wasn't brown it was more like a bright orange as a mango should be and it did taste good. Convenient to mix as it's texture is smooth but still will try and puree my own when mango season comes around.\",\"A_id\":417968,\"B_id\":479766,\"C_id\":377545}}"},

Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br \/><br \/>The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled\/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br \/><br \/>When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br \/><br \/>A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br \/><br \/>It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br \/><br \/>If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand.\",\"A_id\":307475,\"B_id\":258512,\"C_id\":29551}}"},

So if it doesn't set right, I'll get a couple more and try it again in a 3-quart pot.  The reason it boiled over is I thought it would never boil at medium and was getting impatient and turned the burner up too high.  Once it starts to boil, it goes fast.  I do recommend a heavy aluminum pot and stir constantly especially as it gets hotter.

I have no clue as to why a few people gave this product one-star -- my guests (usually sophisticated coffee drinkers) love it and so do I. Maybe it's the type of expresso machine one has .....<br \/><br \/>Old review<br \/>----------<br \/>Price was great. Crema, flavor, and aroma very good. Minor problem is that beans seem to have a bit of external oil, and they sometimes do not all slide down the shallow slope of my expresso maker.<br \/><br \/>P.S. I signed up for monthly deliveries, and they arrive like clockwork (but also make it easy to skip a shipment!).\",\"B\":\"great product but it is from China:\n I don't trust dog treats (or much else) from China.<br \/>WISH AMAZON WOULD StART A MADE IN AMERICA CATEGORY!!<br \/>I love my Amazon prime account.

The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled lemon ginger green tea. It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.\",\"A_id\":332896,\"B_id\":346337,\"C_id\":366449}}"},

Maybe I don't really understand how each is defined but Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried.  The other brands seem to be similar in consistency.  There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds.  The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies.  My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken.  I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal.  The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle.  The consistency does not keep from one day to the next.  If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1.

After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br \/><br \/>She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br \/><br \/>Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to getting older or her hairball sensitivity since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br \/><br \/>After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.<br \/>Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.<br \/><br \/>I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.  Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.

I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br \/><br \/>People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br \/><br \/>Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life.\",\"C\":\"great coffee:\n a couple of the last coffee orders were terible, another brand though,<br \/>this one is really good.

It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing because too many powdered drink mixes use tons & tons of sugar or sugar substitutes. The flavor kind of reminded me of the grape juice most places use for communion wine. (Not a bad flavor, I must admit.) I also liked how many I got per package- I get 10 powder packets per box, which is more than I get in some of the CL boxes.<br \/><br \/>There's only two things that I kind of didn't like about this product. The flavors are nice but I can't imagine myself drinking more than one of these a day. I usually drink quite a bit of flavored drinks at work as a way of avoiding soda & coffee, so this drink was a little much for something to drink repeatedly. Since I usually drink different flavors as the day go on, this shouldn't be that much of an issue & lots of people probably would love to drink a million of these a day if they could.

My dog let me mix the food for two days then refused to touch his bowl if it had the old stuff in it still. The second it was straight Innova again, he'd scarf it down as fast as possible. My dog wholeheartedly approves this food. But beyond his approval, it gets mine and my husband's as well. My dog developed severe allergies to his old stuff, so we were told to try switching his food. There's still no signs of improvement, but as this is only the third day of having Innova, and the first of nothing but Innova, that's not suprising. I'll update in a few weeks if he improves, but even if he stays excessively itchy for the rest of his life, I do feel comfortable with how much healthier this food is for him. Go to Innova's website to get a full list of every single ingredient, vitamin, and mineral, and what each does for a dog's health, for each of their products. I highly doubt I'll stop buying this brand, and I doubt my dog would even let me buy anything else.<br \/><br \/>Update: My dog still has severe allergies, and this food did nothing to stop that; however, it did make him healthier.

I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br \/><br \/>I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3\/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br \/><br \/>For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br \/><br \/>We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br \/><br \/>A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy, instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br \/><br \/>So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1\/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5\/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br \/><br \/>I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br \/><br \/>Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\",\"A_id\":170599,\"B_id\":266724,\"C_id\":318789}}"},

I should have patented it at that time, but what did a 10 year old girl know?<br \/><br \/>As I got older my love for peanut butter grew and I continued to put it on all kinds of things and of course, peanut butter sandwiches.  Sometimes with jelly, sometimes with marshmallow fluff and frequently just plain peanut butter on bread!  To this day, it is still one of my favorites.  Because peanut butter is so fattening, I hardly ever eat it.....until, I discovered PB2.  Oh my goodness, what an awesome, awesome discovery.  Peanut Butter with a fraction of the calories and all of the taste.<br \/><br \/>PB2 is dehydrated peanut butter where the fat has been squeezed out of the peanuts so what is left is pure protein, no guilt goodness!  I'm always dieting and watching my weight and PB2 has made it so much easier.  There are so many ways to eat this PB2.  I add a teaspoon to protein drinks in the morning.  I rehydrate it with water and dip carrots, apples and watermelon in it.  I mix jelly directly into the PB2 and put in inside a whole wheat tortilla and roll it up.  If you like Pad Tai, make some noodles, shred some carrots and other vegetables and toss some PB2 in and you have a nice Pad Thai.<br \/><br \/>When mixed with water, the texture is very similar to smooth peanut butter, but a bit drier because the oil has been removed.  The taste is pure peanut.  A drop of honey can easily be added for a sweet touch.<br \/><br \/>PB2 is easy to travel with and I always have some with me when I leave home as I like to have healthy snacks when the urge hits.<br \/><br \/>I strongly recommend this peanut butter for anyone who loves peanut butter and is watching their weight.

Truvia had a slight aftertaste but nowhere near as strong as this and nowhere near as lasting. I'll be switching back once I finish the SweetLeaf I already paid for.<br \/><br \/>One thing that's worth noting: Ability to taste certain kinds of bitterness varies from person to person due to genetic factors.

They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br \/><br \/>I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.

He taught me what to look for when making wiser food choices.<br \/><br \/>I knew that I wasn't getting enough fiber in my diet, that according to my father that carboyhydrates turn into sugar, which fiber helps to counterbalance that out, and to limit the amount of sugar that I eat.<br \/><br \/>So, now I read every food label if there is one before I make a food purchase.  It does take longer to grocery shop, but in almost a year I have lost 37 pounds, which at least to me is impressive. I know that alot of my weight loss is due to eating healthier, watching what I eat, making healthier food choices.  After awhile of doing this it does become a way of life.  The scale does NOT lie!!<br \/><br \/>So, I started trying various granola bars, and have found that Kellogg's makes my favorite granola bars as well as other healthy snacks that are also low in carbohydrates, high in fiber, and low in sugar.<br \/><br \/>My father told me to limit the amount of carbohydrates I eat in any given product to less than 20 grams, there are 17 grams in these Special K Chocolately Peanut Butter Granola Bars, there are 4 grams of fiber which is 16% of your daily fiber, so these are definitely a good source of fiber, and my father told me to limit my sugars in any given product to less than 10 grams.  These granola bars have 7 grams of sugar.<br \/><br \/>To me they taste almost like a candy bar so that I do not feel deprived.  These particular granola bars are chewy, have a chocolate peanutty taste that is not overwhelming.  They do leave me feeling satisfied, and they also help to control my appetite.<br \/><br \/>The total fat grams are 3 grams, which is only 5% of your daily value.  The amount of saturated fat is 2 grams, which is 10% of your daily value, and 4 grams of protein which is 6% of your daily value.<br \/><br \/>These granola bars have 10 % of thiamin,niacin,and vitamin B6.  Each bar is 110 calories.  The amount of sodium per bar is 85 mg, which is 4% of your daily value.<br \/><br \/>What is helpful is on the front of the box they do spell out on the upper right hand corner of the box how many calories each bar has, as well as how much saturated fat, sodium, and sugars in each bar for quick reference.  The front of the box also shows that there are 4 grams of fiber per bar, which is in a green circle, and 4 grams of protein is in a blue circle.<br \/><br \/>Each box contains 5 granola bars.  I do want to warn you which I have found that most products that do contain a fair amount of fiber in them, they tell you to increase your fiber intake slowly, because if you do eat too much fiber at one time it will cause some intestinal discomfort.<br \/><br \/>Products that are high in fiber do leave you feeling full longer.<br \/><br \/>To me, Kellogg's products have a proven time tested track record quality to them, and they continue to come out with new and healthier products, which is really a plus for those of us who are trying to eat healthier, and making wiser food choices, to have such a wide array of products to choose from.<br \/><br \/>As long as Kellogg's continues to come out with new innovative food products, I will be continue to buy them.<br \/><br \/>They have so many food choices to pick from, you will never get bored or feel deprived, and as an added bonus you will feel healthier too, and lose some weight in the process.<br \/><br \/>To me these Kellogg's Granola Bars are good food choice for everyone, whether you are trying to lose weight or not.\",\"C\":\"Made in china:\n My shitzu pups love these treats but I just read the fine print and discovered that the California company imports this from china.

They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left. I think that speaks for itself. I will continue to purchase Don Pepino pizza sauce and I highly recommend that you give it a try!\",\"C\":\"Just my favorite cheese - ever!:\n Of all of the sheep's milk cheeses available, Kasseri is just my all-time favorite.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Great Chips Less Fat:\n I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of regular chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br \/><br \/>Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br \/><br \/>The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br \/>Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br \/>Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br \/>Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br \/>Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.\",\"B\":\"Favorite chocolate bar in the world:\n I first tried this at a small coffee shop and the memory of the taste haunted me until I found it on Amazon.

I have two kitties and one was 3 mo and one 9 mo when I first began ordering this for them. The 9 month old was already a wet food eater, but the little 3 month old had lived in a rescue situation most of her life and was only familiar with kibble. The older kitten began to gobble it up immediately. The little female was not so sure what this stuff was. The first night she had it, she had two or three bites and went back to her kibble. But she soon learned that life was better with a mixture and she began to eat the Turkey also. I could have stayed with the less expensive kibble, but I feed wet food because I want the male to get all the fluid in him that he can to avoid urinary tract problems. So I feed wet and dry.<br \/>This food lasts for a long time. Both of my kitties are free feeders. Their wet food is put out and left for 24 hours until the next day when two new cans magically appear for them. The kibble is always available. The get to go outside a little while each day while I watch them, and we play with Da Bird and other toys almost daily. So, even if food is out, they stay trim. But the food stays good for longer than 24 hours. They eat all they want and then I leave left over wet and some dry food for the ferals who live around in the back yard. The ferals eat the Turkey after it is 24 hours old and they do not turn up their noses. When they are through, the birds come in and finish the plate.<br \/>It is now July 2011 and the kitties still eat the Turkey Tuscany. They don't get it every night, but they do get it about once a week. It has remained a mainstay of their diet while other things have come and gone.<br \/>So I am really pleased with the Turkey Tuscany. My kitties eat abot 7\/8 of a can and leave a few bites for the ferals who gobble it down with their dry food. With my kitties, the feral kitties, and then the birds finishing up any stray bite, it certainly never goes to waste.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"1960-s Guang Yun Beeng:\n I haven't tried this tea yet, but the description is a little misleading.  When it is said that this cake can make 75 servings, what they really mean is that you can have 75 Gong-fu sessions with this tea.  This type of Chinese tea is typically put into very small Yixing teapots (approx 5-7gr of tea into a 110-120 ml teapot), rinsed once or twice (probably once for this expensive tea), and then poured into teacups.  A very high-quality Puerh (aged raw, not aged cooked) can make anywhere from 5-10 teapots-full of the tea before running out of leaf.  Sometimes even more.  Usually the desired effect of these very-old teas is not exactly how they taste, because often-times they won't taste like much more than flavored water, but instead the Cha-Chi, which is a type of energy or feeling that your body feels when\/after drinking these teas.  The feelings can be anything from quite stimulating, to very soothing (almost narcotic).  There are many fakes in the market-place, due to extremely rare occurences of any REALLY good, old raw Puerh tea being found outside of Asia.  Any that are found will definitely command very high prices because this type of tea is usually hoarded in China, Taiwan, and anywhere else that anyone can find any of it available for purchase.  Also, when someone states 60's Puerh tea, that is a whole decade of variance to deal with.  Before taking the plunge with Puerh tea, start doing your research.  Puerh tea has really been taking hold of the West in recent years, and now the East is capitalizing on our desires for really good Puerh teas.  There are some very good reliable sources out there, but it usually incurs a monetary learning-curve before you get the hang of who you can trust, and what Puerh teas may be right for you.  BUYER BEWARE!  I hope I am not overstepping any bounds by saying this, but a good place to start learning about Puerh tea would be Puerh Tea- A Westerner's Quest website.  Good luck, and Good health!\",\"B\":\"A pleasant surprise:\n Tasty Bite Multigrain Pilaf is a mildly spicy blend of millet, cracked wheat, and soybeans.

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br \/><br \/>The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br \/><br \/>The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation spices is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br \/><br \/>.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br \/><br \/>Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br \/><br \/>Review by M. Reynard 2012\",\"B\":\"Nostalgia tastes delicious!!:\n I debated about buying this for months, but I'm so glad I did!

I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.\",\"C\":\"My Boys Sent This Back To The Kitchen:\n But I still believe it is an excellent cat food, for the right kind of cat.  Tiki Cat is definitely a top of the line cat food: I opened up one can to find a perfectly round ring of calamari resting atop succulent morsels of fish.  My problem is that when I ordered this variety pack I neglected to keep in mind that my boys don't really care for wet food that comes in chunks or even flakes.  They are the kind of dudes who enjoy their wet food in a pate or souffle form.  So although they slurped down the gravy in these cans, they left all the chunky bits behind and then glared at me as if to say: You don't expect us to chew this, do you?<br \/><br \/>Tiki Cat comes in big juicy chunks that look good enough for people to eat, and if that's the way your cat likes wet food, then I think this will be a delectable dining option for them.  I just wish they made a nice pate style for my boys because I think they'd really respond better.<br \/><br \/>ETA: There is a feral cat, named Spanky, who comes by for a meal quite often.  I have given him some of the leftover cans of Tiki Cat and he **loves** it.  He licks the bowl clean and then sits in the sun for a nice long bath. Spanky is polydactyl, so he can and does give Tiki Cat two thumbs way, way up.\",\"A_id\":116417,\"B_id\":365318,\"C_id\":362218}}"},

It is very dusty, reddish-brown in color, and the texture is very fine.  The leaves do not curl like tea leaves.<br \/><br \/>I made the rooibos in both a stovetop espresso maker and in a regular drip coffee maker but I don't have a french press or an electric espresso machine.  I also did not try it brewed loose in a pot because that is not suggested.<br \/><br \/>Compared to normal steeped rooibos, it is a bit stronger and has more body, presumably due to the finer grind.  The stovetop method makes a stronger brew than the drip maker and this presumably has to do with the filter in the drip maker and the higher water temperature and pressure from conversion to steam in the espresso method.  The strength of the prepared beverage is also determined by how much rooibos you use.<br \/><br \/>After each method of preparation, i tasted it plain, with raw sugar, and then with both raw sugar and milk.  I did not try to froth the milk or add anything else because I don't take coffee or tea that way, drinking them plain most of the time, occasionally with milk and sugar, and very rarely with sugar only.  I didn't try it with honey because I did not think the honey flavor would go well with it although I frequently use honey in tea, more often than sugar.  I prefer the stovetop espresso method taken with sugar only.<br \/><br \/>The prepared beverage certainly has a beautiful, rich color, quite remarkable, like old cherry or mahogany.  The flavor is similar to the smell, a bit like green tea with a strong moist or even musty hay- or grass-like flavor that lingers on the tongue for a very long time, over an hour.  It is a quite complex flavor, definitely not one-note.  I don't particularly care for the taste, I must confess, but I am rating it on quality, not on my personal preferences in hot beverages.  I wouldn't hesitate to offer it to guests, especially if they had never had rooibos.<br \/><br \/>I am not impressed with it as a substitute for coffee or tea as a way to avoid caffeine because decaffeinated versions of both coffee and tea are readily available.  The health appeal doesn't seduce me, either, because I know of no reliable independent research clearly demonstrating favorable health outcomes in humans from drinking rooibos.  Because of the price, I would experiment with regular loose-leaf rooibos and run it through a coffee grinder or food processor or even a blender if I decided that this were something I wanted to drink on a regular basis and that achieving a fine grind was important to the final product.<br \/><br \/>The novelty of preparing rooibos with coffee equipment and the stronger than average brew that lends itself to fancy methods of presentation should appeal to many and from that viewpoint I can give it a favorable rating.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE:<br \/>What a mess!  I just made another pot with an electric drip machine and this time the filter completely clogged up and the brew overflowed all over the counter and clean floor (mopped it yesterday) and even got into the heating element of the Mr. Coffee.  Make sure if you use an electric drip machine that you don't leave it alone while brewing.  Better yet, use a different method of brewing.<br \/><br \/>It is interesting that I actually used less of the rooibos this morning than I did during the original test.  I use standard paper filters.\",\"C\":\"Emeril Big,Easy Bold best coffee k-cups on the market today!:\n Emeril's Big,Easy Bold best coffee k-cups on the market today!

Coffee was my perker-upper of choice, and loved every jittery cup of it. I still like my morning cup and the aroma of good coffee brewing in the morning. Whenever offered tea by friends I'd always decline - coffee if you've got it please. I would settle for the last of a pot that had been heating for hours rather then try tea. So to say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant, or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. So when I say I Love This Tea - you can be sure that's the truth as well.<br \/><br \/>It started with a coupon. It was a bargain to pick some up at my local market, and thought well, maybe I should have some on hand for all those tea lovers I know. Hearing so much about the benefits of green tea, I picked out a box of it and put it up on a shelf. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on this Good Earth Lemongrass. This one I loved.It was the best I tried. So naturally my next stop was here at Amazon. And naturally I found this great deal.<br \/><br \/>The taste is wonderful and so is the aroma. Light and citrusy, but slightly sweet - not what I thought lemongrass would be.I didn't need to add anything at all. It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffe per serving. It gives me a renewed and refreshed energy in the afternoons without any jitteryness.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating - as coffee can be.Not to mention the other health benefits. According to the box, this blend is rich in antioxidants. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br \/><br \/>Ingredients: Green Tea,Lemongrass,Natural Flavors,Rose petals and Peppermint.<br \/><br \/>As I said, Amazon has the best deal. I bought the six pack of 25 bag boxes. One box comes out to be less then the 20 bag box sold at my market.It is also sold in multi packs of the 20 bag boxes here as well:<a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000F6SNQM>Good Earth Green Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6)  [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging<\/a>].<br \/><br \/>Oh and on the tag of each bag(which are slit to sit on the edge of the cup) are some delightful and inspiring quotations or proverbs that may start you out with a smile.

It is fairly sweet and has a smooth, peanut butter-like texture.<br \/><br \/>I didn't want to put it on a salty cracker and didn't have any plain\/neutral biscuit type crackers and I didn't really need to add the calories, so I developed the habit of just eating a spoonful of it when I needed a little treat or dessert.

Then I tried to take one to my sister and my jar got confiscated at the airport security check!  I was so upset.

Shipping is $4.99 - no matter the quantity. Much better than the $9 plus a jar from the other sellers and Amazon Prime. I just ordered 10 more jars for a total of $41.99. They make great gifts. I can't imagine anyone not loving Biscoff Spread - unless they absolutely hate anything sweet.<br \/><br \/>One tablespoon is 89 calories and 6 grams of fat, lower than peanut butter and most days just one tablespoon is very satisfying.

I saw that she measured the ingredients incorrectly as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.

And, importantly to those of us who think tea cups can never be too large, it is powerful enough to make one very large cup, or two normal sized cups.<br \/><br \/>Some of the flavor can likely be credited to the sachets that the tea is packaged in. Triangle shaped tea bags made out of a silken material, they have been used for years by fine tea producers, (and are not unique to Lipton, no matter their claims). They are a compromise between using loose tea and traditional tea bags. Loose tea is made with larger leaves\/herbals, because they are able to spread through the water and infuse easily. Traditional tea bags are made with smaller pieces because they have less surface area that can be exposed, limiting their ability to infuse the water, and resulting in a brisker\/sharper flavor. Sachets are a compromise between the two; the leaves\/herbals are larger, resulting in less briskness, i.e. better flavor, but you still have the ease of use of a tea bag.<br \/><br \/>Even if Blackberry Vanilla isn't for you, Lipton has got the sachets right, and I would recommend trying another in the line to see what a difference it makes to the flavor.\",\"A_id\":251758,\"B_id\":436129,\"C_id\":521490}}"},

In fact, it changed my life, awakening an interest in urban gardening.  Having proceeded to get up to my chin in hydroponics, I bought 5000 shares in Aerogrow (pretty cheap at its current price).<br \/><br \/>I received my first Aerogarden (I have two) as a gift.  The first thing I grew was lettuce.  You don't know what you're missing until you've yanked fresh leaves off of living lettuce right on your kitchen counter to put in your sandwich!  So simple, so fresh (no refrigeration!).  Anyone who buys lettuce regularly should consider replacing that habit with this, the 7-pod Aerogarden.<br \/><br \/>The complaints that interest me the most are those regarding the cost of seed kits, the failure of supplied seeds to germinate, or the failure of plants to grow adequately.  Currently I have one Aerogarden going.  The only Aerogarden-supplied plant in there is a cherry tomato.  The others I supplied myself: three pods are growing miniature Mexican sour gherkins (a sort of miniature cucumber) and another is growing purple tomatillos.  The remaining two pods I am using for experiments.  I asked myself, could I germinate fruit trees in my Aerogarden?  The answer is yes.  An apple seed (simply from a grocery store apple) is now a four-inch tree, and an orange seed is just starting to get going.  I have also grown small varieties of eggplant and sweet peppers to (delicious!) maturity.  So, I recommend that you acquire your own seeds rather than rely on the Aerogarden seed kits.  (Do consider whether a given plant will fit the dimensions of the Aerogarden.  I started an okra plant in it and it did too well, too fast--for one thing, I didn't know that okra leaves are gigantic!)  In fact, I think the company should give up on the seed kits and just concentrate on selling the basic things you need to plant your own seeds (like the sponges).  They do already offer these items, by the way.<br \/><br \/>The Aerogarden is not a Ronco-like novelty item.  It is simply hydroponics made simple.  There is currently, to my knowledge, no other all-in-one hydroponics setup available.  The closest competitor was the Prepara Power Plant, now no longer manufactured.<br \/><br \/>If you were to put together a similar set-up yourself (which you can do, as the construction is easy to understand), you would find that your $100 would not buy much more than a proper lighting fixture and light bulbs.  Incidentally, the light has a marvelous daylight quality which I find brightens the mood of the room.  This might be a consideration for you if you live far north (esp. in Seattle, I would think!).<br \/><br \/>I haven't noticed any reviews that mention placing an Aerogarden in an office.  While the 3-pod and 6-pod models might be slightly too noise for that setting (they operate on a different principle), the 7-pod model is whisper quiet and would, I think, be just as welcome in an office or lobby as an aquarium.\",\"A_id\":235761,\"B_id\":425105,\"C_id\":190641}}"},

Now, to serve her a daily dose of powdered medication, I have to mix a small amount of the powder with moist, canned food; which is why I even give her moist food.  She would smell or taste the medicine and not touch it if it wasn't mixed right, and she would eat right around it.  So, for her to eat these, I was quite pleased.  They are small, about the size of a piece of puffed wheat; and very hard and crunchy; I can hear her crunching from ten feet away.<br \/><br \/>The ingredients list corn flour, chcken meal, wheat flour and corn gluten meal as the first of many listed. The label say's with nutritious vitamins & minerals plus the essential amino acid taurine and under 2 calories per treat.  The calorie count at the bottom notes 1.1 calorie per treat.  Label advertises that the product removes 3 times more tartar than regular cat treats, and includes an ingredient called Denta Shield, which supposedly creates a shield to prohibit further tartar build up.  The consumer has no way of verifying this of course, but I will assume that if this is even half true, and she is getting half the vitamins, it is better than nothing.  If she won't eat it, it won't do her any good.<br \/><br \/>Now, the second time I fed her today, I offered her three more treats, and she declined to eat them, so appetite appears to have some affect on her desire to eat them.\",\"A_id\":421128,\"B_id\":61136,\"C_id\":187938}}"},

I hadn't heard of the brand, so visited the company's website.  I was pleased that the company stated it did not use any ingredients from China, especially in light of the well-publicized problems in that country's food supply.  (I was not, however, pleased to see that the product arrived in a box labeled Made in Thailand.  I would not have willing chosen the food from the store if I had seen that label.)<br \/><br \/>My cats don't eat wet food too often...I tend to think of it as kitty junk food.  But they are always pleased when I serve it, meowing loudly until I get the food onto a plate and down to the floor.<br \/><br \/>On the first day, we tried the Chinese Chicken.  When I opened it, I actually thought it smelled fairly good.  (Not that I was going to taste it, but it did not smell like yucky cat food.)  The chicken was clearly identifiable as white meat chicken with bits of carrot.  The cats' first reaction was to sniff the food cautiously (I assume they were confused by the scent).  The younger cat ate a few bites and walked away.  The older cat (who is fatter and usually licks the plate clean) ate a few more bites, then he was done.<br \/><br \/>On day two, we tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  As I was opening the can, I noticed that it sounded very watery, and upon opening the can, this was confirmed.  The food had chunks of chicken, carrots, and some type of small white bits.  The cats did not like this food as much as the Chinese Chicken.  They licked up the sauce and left.<br \/><br \/>Except for its country of origin, I was pleased with the quality of the food.  The chicken looked like chicken, the carrots like carrots, etc.  At less than a dollar a can, it is comparable to other retail brands.

For starters, I don't like using malt extract out of a can.  I've tried it a few times, and it's never really been good.  Drinkable, but not very good.  I'm also not a huge fan of powdered extracts.  When extract brewing, I prefer to buy from my local home-brew shop.  A local home-brew shop will likely have a bulk supply of fresh extract that they can sell to you in a food-grade plastic container.  Personally, I feel that this does affect the taste of the finished product.<br \/><br \/>Next, the hops pellets.  Okay, these things can go stale and produce off-flavors.  Any good home-brew store will keep their hops and hops pellets in a refrigerator to preserve freshness.  This is not something you can do with a kit in a box.<br \/><br \/>Finally, the yeast...does what it is supposed to do, I guess.

I recall trying Starbucks VIA in stores a few months ago, and the barista telling me that it could dissolve in cold water or milk (unlike normal instant coffees), and tucked it away in the back of my head to try it this summer.  I was pleasantly surprised when Starbucks came out with the VIA Iced Coffee packages, mostly because it was designed for a 16 oz serving and lightly sweetened with sugar (100 calories in the entire packet, 50 calories for an 8 oz serving).  I add it directly to 16 oz of skim milk, add a little extra sweetener, and shake it all up in a water bottle.  It's delicious!  It has the classic Starbucks coffee flavor, without being overly bitter, because the coffee hasn't been brewed.  It dissolves almost instantly, sugar and coffee and all, in COLD liquid, with no residue or sediment at the bottom.<br \/><br \/>At $1.00 a packet, it's not cheap - but it is cheaper than getting an iced coffee at Starbucks, and just as delicious - plus, you don't need to leave your house.  I used to make cold brewed coffee to drink iced, but that has to be done the night before to extract the full flavor, and then you need to strain it, and to make larger quantities was just cumbersome without the right equipment.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.

I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.

I found it on Amazon earlier this year after being unable to find it in local stores, and I've just recently gone through the first twelve-pack (okay, I gave one pack to my mother-in-law).<br \/><br \/>I've converted my daughter and my mother-in-law to it, as well; they're both chili lovers and we use this recipe together with dark red kidney beans, diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce, and ground turkey (healthier, and cheaper, and there's a small difference in texture and none in taste from ground beef).  We recommend going with the recipe option that calls for a large can of diced tomatoes, and about half the cayenne packet, and about 32 oz of canned dark red kidney beans, drained (the recipe only recommends 16 oz), and between 2 and 3 lbs of ground whatever.<br \/><br \/>Ground beef, not too lean, or chopped chuck, or cubed pot roast are all good candidates for the meat.  As the package used to say, fifteen years ago, don't waste your money on expensive cuts of beef here.<br \/><br \/>The directions are pretty basic and perfectly adequate to produce a good hearty meal.  Use a _big_ frying pan, 13 if you've got one, and have a larger stew pot\/saucepan of some kind standing by in case your ingredients are too much for the pan.  Do stir frequently once you've added the spices and flour, because there's some tendency for the mix to thicken up and form a skin on the bottom of the pot, and you'll lose good flavor that way (not to mention the bottom might get burned and ruin the whole recipe).<br \/><br \/>With 2-3 lbs of meat, two cans of beans and a large (28 oz) can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, the whole thing makes six or seven _really_ generous portions (12-14 oz each).

The description says: Perky Jerky, the caffeinated beef jerky is an all-natural, great tasting snack with a kick: an energy-drink's worth of invigorating caffeine in each serving.

And although it's available locally, the six-pack sold through Amazon seems to offer about the best available price.<br \/><br \/>As my review title suggests, you get not eight, not ten, not twelve, but _fourteen_ kinds of veggie juice in this mix. And you can taste pretty much all of them. Just chill a bottle of it in your fridge, pour a glass, toss it at your tonsils, and wait; aha, there's the tomato, and there's the carrot, and there's the broccoli . . .<br \/><br \/>What I usually do with bottled\/canned vegetable juice is to modify it myself with a dash (or six) of hot pepper sauce, some lemon juice, a bit of salt, and a healthy dollop of Worcestershire sauce. Well, I tried that with this juice and found that I liked it _better_ without my own modifications. This is a nice, flavorful, carefully balanced mix, and my tinkering didn't improve it.[*]<br \/><br \/>Which is good for another reason: this stuff is pretty low in salt, and it relies on pepper and garlic to give it a little bite. So if you're watching your sodium, you'll be glad to know that one 8-oz. glass includes just 4% of your RDA and doesn't require supplementation in order to taste good.<br \/><br \/>Good juice.<br \/><br \/>(The product image shown on this page at the time I'm writing is a little weird-looking; it makes the juice look orange, which it isn't. The predominant ingredient is tomato juice, and that's what this stuff looks like.)<br \/><br \/>----<br \/><br \/>[*] However, I've discovered since writing this review that I do like to add a splash of <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001M1DUDU>Lakewood Organic PURE Lemon Juice, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)<\/a> or <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001M1IQ3Y>Lakewood Organic PURE Lime Juice, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)<\/a>.

The antioxidants will help but what really made a difference with me was that I'd replaced a few of my other drinks with this tea. (Sodas & other caffeinated beverages do not do good things for your skin.) Plus the drink has plenty of soothing herbs in it (chamomile, my favorite!), which helps lessen stress- something else that will probably help you see improvements. I recommend it just for the stress benefits alone.<br \/><br \/>Taste-wise, this is a strange concoction. Not bad, just different. There's a lot of flavors here to taste but somehow it works out well. What I loved most about this was that you really didn't need sugar in this drink- it tastes just as good without it than it would with it. I also loved that it was good cold, which will come in handy when it gets really warm.<br \/><br \/>So the bottom line? This will absolutely help you out health-wise but don't expect dramatic improvements.\",\"A_id\":214849,\"B_id\":178661,\"C_id\":56043}}"},

My hope was that they would give me a nice protein boost once or twice during the day.  While they might have given me some protein, they also came with a huge side serving of aggravation -- and they don't taste very good to boot.<br \/><br \/>First, the almond butter itself is simply not very good.  If, like me, you're used to almond butter from natural food stores, you're used to one ingredient -- almonds.  With Barney Butter, they load it up with extra oils and salt.  It tastes too sweet and too salty as a result.  This is like the McDonald's of almond butter.  Also, the separation problems cannot be easily overcome in a little packet like this.  With a jar, you just stir.  With a squeeze packet, you can try to keep kneading it and mixing it up before opening it, but the reality is, you're in for a huge blast of oil when you first open it, followed by a clay-like almond paste down below.<br \/><br \/>Second, the packaging is straight-up awful.  It's made of reinforced plastic, so you basically need talons to rip it open.  Why they went with double-thick plastic for something you're supposed to tear is beyond me.  Then, once it's open, the oil separation problems described above make it hard to get the almond butter to keep pushing up.  You have to keep tearing it again or cutting it as you inch your way down the tube.  And if you try to use your teeth to drag the almond butter up to the opening, you're in for some unpleasant cuts in the corners of your mouth due to the wide size of the packet.  It's just an all-around mess.<br \/><br \/>I would never buy a jar of Barney Butter due to the unnecessary extra ingredients and weird taste, and I would certainly never buy these snack packs again due to the ridiculous packaging.  In the future, I'll just go back to carrying a little jar of real almond butter with me when I travel.  At least I can open that.\",\"C\":\"Good service:\n It's difficult to find jasmine tea made with green tea...Amazon carries it, I order it, it comes very quickly...and everybody is happy!

I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my baby each day.<br \/><br \/>Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br \/><br \/>I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br \/><br \/>At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br \/><br \/>Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br \/><br \/>The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br \/><br \/>Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br \/><br \/>Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br \/><br \/>I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br \/><br \/>Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br \/><br \/>(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br \/><br \/>So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br \/><br \/>Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br \/><br \/>if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br \/><br \/>So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br \/><br \/>He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br \/><br \/>I, personally, have helped friends CURE health issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept treating without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and cured them!<br \/><br \/>Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br \/><br \/>I am a raving fan.<br \/><br \/>and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.\",\"A_id\":422055,\"B_id\":210222,\"C_id\":506617}}"},

Call us primitive, but the hand-in-box method helps us stay full all day without gorging on junk food via drive-thru or conveniently placed over-priced vending machines.<br \/><br \/>Kellogg's new cinnamon-flavored Mini-Wheats certainly was consumed in the aforementioned method by myself and my house-sitting brother and we came up with the following results; cool.<br \/><br \/>Truth be told, they tasted like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but in Mini-Wheat form.  Makes sense, really, as all they had to do was swap around the flavor dispensers and called it good.  This isn't a bad thing, it just isn't a new and revolutionary idea like Krave was (something I could definitely get addicted to).  I enjoyed munching on them, but it just isn't munch food given how easily the Mini-Wheats fall apart in my hands.  Maybe I should try a spoon?  Either way, it just wasn't for me, but they tasted good all the same.\",\"A_id\":322648,\"B_id\":148493,\"C_id\":433881}}"},

After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br \/><br \/>The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.

It is easy to mix into warm or cold foods and tastes like a light brown sugar when baked or broiled.  It is no more expensive than any other palm sugars -- and it is organic.  Hopefully, Sweet Tree will make this available to us in larger quantities.  I bake, roast, broil and boil using the Sweet Tree palm sugar every week. Although palm sugar may not be for everyone, I was a border line diabetic, but after using many other artificial sweeteners with no success, palm sugar has helped to bring my AIC sugar level readings under diabetic levels. (Every individual reacts differently to sugar and artifical sweeteners. If you are diabetic it is very important when making a change to your diet to check your sugar levels at the appropriate time after consuming any unfamiliar sugar or sweetener products.)\",\"B\":\"Tasty, but not enough food for the price:\n I pack a lunch every single day, because if I don't, I wind up begging someone to cover for me while I do the Burger King drive-thru.

I was a little worried that the salmon spread might be gross, but it wasn't, and it wasn't boring, either. The assortment of sides is nice, and they're all tasty, too, although I think the edamame could have used a little more salt.<br \/><br \/>However, it's not enough food for me for lunch, and I'm not a big eater. When I do the Burger King thing, I get a Whopper Jr and a value fry, and I never finish the fries. This is 410 calories if you eat every bite, and I think my optimum lunch intake is ~500 calories. Maybe if I paired it with soda or juice it would do the job, but I try hard to drink only water, so...I'd rather supplement it with other food. That kind of defeats the purpose though.<br \/><br \/>The other thing that will likely keep me from buying these after my Vine-supply runs out is just the price. $4 each isn't horrendous for a lunch, and it's worth the extra to me over a Whopper\/fry meal, but it's a lot more than packing leftovers.

An 'on sale' purchase only:\n I thought that adding ginger to chicken soup was pleasantly tasty, but it was a bit bland. I wish this had more ginger flavor. If you dont have MSG, or more salt, you gotta add something. The vegetables were still pretty hard - I cooked it by adding boiling water and waiting 3 minutes. Also, there was a very small amount of pieces of vegetables. I think even one or two actual slices of mushroom would increase the perceived value greatly. The noodles reconstituted nicely, as they do with all versions of these soups, and there was a nice serving of them. I would have liked to see maybe even slightly less noodles if it meant more vegetables. An optional spice flavor packet would be really nice too.<br \/><br \/>I didnt think this was bad but I wasnt that impressed. This would probably be improved with a little soy sauce or spice. I know they are trying to limit the salt but i've had other soups with 1000mg of sodium (the amount in this soup - they claim 2 servings but thats a joke and deceives many people) or less, and it tasted better. Also, when cooking, do not use more water then specified. 1 cup is enough; any more will substantially dilute the taste. I would recommend trying this once but after that, unless its $1.50 or less, I dont think its a repeat for me.<br \/><br \/>I saw this at my local publix for - get this - a whopping $4.79. Its certainly NOT worth that price.

The flavor is really clean and natural, and the sweetness, though from artificial sources, (Sucralose) isn't off-putting.  I'd prefer it unsweetened but it's not horrible; I'm fine with it.<br \/><br \/>I've tried it in water and in hot and cold tea, and in each case, MiO enhanced the beverage.  It's easy to use and each bottle looks to have a fairly generous amount of flavoring in it. (At least it does for me; I use one squirt for anything up to a liter of liquid.<br \/><br \/>At this price point, MiO is a very good alternative to soda, in my opinion.  There are a lot of different flavors, so if mango-peach doesn't suit, you have other choices.  I liked this one so much I'm tempted to try some of the others.  How much more of a recommendation could you ask for?\",\"A_id\":165571,\"B_id\":45882,\"C_id\":497153}}"},

Well, these do not fit that profile. There is so much chocolate covering the raisin that there are no discernible wrinkles to be seen. This is on top of the fact that they were double the size of what I normally view a chocolate covered raisin. Truth be told, when I first looked at the bag, I thought I had received chocolate covered peanuts or something. The label readily allayed that fear.<br \/>Nonetheless, I was still skeptical and had thoughts of giant raisins inside a thick coating of chocolate. Well, the raisins seem to of normal stature after comparing one sans chocolate. But the chocolate coating was definitely thick. Therefore, if you like chocolate with a little raisin mixed in, you'll love this Koppers product (that's me). If you would prefer a little chocolate with your raisin, maybe the Sunmaid brand would be more suitable.<br \/>I purchased the Sunmaid product and liked it as well. Packaging is a little nicer compared to Koppers' plastic bag. However, it does make a lot of noise during shipping.

It's also completely filling and satisfying.<br \/><br \/>I'm pre-diabetic and so far seem to have elevated blood sugar only in the mornings, so this may not be relevant to people with full diabetes, but here are the results of my tests. An evening meal including a double portion of Dreamfields and 30 grams of carbs from another dish gave me a modest rise in blood sugar, about what I'd expect from a 40-50 gram meal. On another occasion when I ate a double portion of Dreamfields alone in the late morning, my blood sugar had dropped slightly six hours later. I had read a couple of people complaining that they got high readings eight hours or so after eating Dreamfields but this doesn't seem to happen to me.<br \/><br \/>Extra fiber is always another plus. With the lowered carbs Dreamfields should also be lower calorie but there don't seem to be any official claims for that.<br \/><br \/>Again according to my readings: don't overcook it, reheat it, or cook it in something acidic like tomato sauce or the carb-hiding effect will be lost. (It's fine to add tomato sauce after the pasta is cooked.)<br \/><br \/>The only drawback is the price, but it's well worth it to be able to eat pasta and not be concerned about the carbs.\",\"C\":\"Ham:\n This ham had a much different taste than the hams yot purchase in the store.

The greatest difficulty was putting on the casing.  You have to put the nozzle in the adapter (the piece in the far left of the picture), but there's not a way to lock the nozzle in place so you have to work at it to get leverage to get the casing on.

Our Vet checks were good, and they settled into our home quickly. The only issue was with their digestion\/stools. At first, hoped it was just stress, but it persisted for a few weeks. The premium food we selected was an upgrade from the cereal filled budget food they had at the shelter, but evidently, the richer protein level (29-32%) of Taste of Wild and Premium Edge did not go down well for both pups. While they appeared to enjoy the food, eating it all, it just never set well with them. We did put the pups on Science Diet (digestion special) for a short term, but the pups did not seem to like the food and it only partially appeared to solve their issue. After reading several reviews and noting that some people experienced issues with wheat or grain based food\/treats, we decided to try Blue Buffalo Freedom for both the grain free and higher fiber ingredients. Magic! Both pups love the food, and digestion has been resolved. Stress still disrupts their system a bit, such as after a rigorous day at the park running and wrestling with other dogs, but their digestion clears up quickly. Note: We also limit their treats to non-grain\/no wheat as much as possible. Natural Balance has mostly potato and meat based treats. Our only wish, Amazon would carry the Large Dog (orange label) Freedom version. We use kibble balls to keep the Aussie\/McNab mix working, and the standard size kibble (blue label) is too small and pours out of the kibble ball. Cheers to Blue Buffalo Freedom and scoopable poop!

She's a picky eater, so when I opened the first can and she started yowling Give it to me NOW like Veruca Salt, I figured I had a winner. The vet we had at the time - hereafter known as Old Vet - didn't see anything wrong with it, so Weruva became her diet.<br \/><br \/>Kitty, who has always been a pudgy little picture of health, started losing weight last year. Old Vet was not concerned at first and certainly did not attribute her weight loss to her food. However, when it progressed from half a poiund, to one, to more than three, a battery of tests was clearly in order.  At that point (July) Kitty was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid and kidney disease. Frequent visits to Old Vet for diagnosis and treatment began... lots of fun, as you can imagine. Food was again not deemed to be a problem.<br \/><br \/>A month ago Kitty started having continual problems with her bowels and developed a raging kidney infection. Old Vet put her on an antibiotic. Symptoms worsened. She appeared to be in rapid decline and was thoroughly miserable. The antibiotic only made a slight difference, and Old Vet wasn't giving us helpful answers, so we went to see New Vet. New Vet ordered more blood work (fourth draw of the year - oh boy).  When New Vet got the results, she immediately prescribed another course of antibiotics, and a new prescription diet.<br \/><br \/>Whoda thunk? It's been one week, and hallelujah! Kitty's recovery has been drastic. I feel like we dodged a bullet... and now I have 40 cans of Weruva to get rid of. I can't prove that Weruva is the culprit for my cat's health problems, and I absolve neither Old Vet nor myself for missing the connection to baby's diet.

That's what happens when you go to high school in Tennessee and college in Kentucky. But it looked interesting and I liked the brandy I've had, so I thought why not?

But I don't really have a flavor profile in mind when I try this matcha, so it will be an interesting experience. For instance, when I try a pineapple tea, I have in mind what I think a pineapple should taste like and I can match the tea up to that flavor profile and see how it compares.

In any case, to keep peace in the household, I agreed that we would drink bottled water. We gradually settled in on Kirkland Signature bottled water. The price was right!

The hanging catcher also is easily disposed of - be sure to snap down the yellow plastic top into the holes and the bag will be sealed for throwing into the garbage.

These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great hearty cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.\",\"C\":\"Soothing Asian Flavors !!!:\n Our Asian-American family was introduced to Nong Shim through Amazon last year.

As I got older, I started to get away from the cereal in favor of things like whole-grain English muffins.  This was because the cereals out there were either chock full of sugar or healthy and, therefore, tasteless with a cardboard-like texture.  Kashi to the rescue!<br \/><br \/>I particularly love this cereal because of the honey flavor.  It is a nice, light flavor and has what I consider to be the perfect degree of sweetness.  Unlike with sugar cereals, I don't have the sensation of instant tooth decay when I eat this one.  Better yet, the cereal is a blend of whole grains.  I find that eating this cereal and other Kashi products helps me to stay full longer and also makes me less likely to crave sugary goods.  I've long been reluctant to let my daughter eat much cereal for breakfast for the abovementioned reasons but she loves this cereal just as much as I do.  It's definitely gratifying to be able to serve my daughter something that she not only loves, but that I know is also healthy for her.\",\"B\":\"My Longboys:\n This has always been one of my favorites, so seeing it on my favorite online shopping site was fantastic!

It was really no bargain.\",\"C\":\"Surprisingly good:\n I have a small batch coffee roaster and often roast my own coffee from green coffee beans.  So I think that I know a fair amount about what is and what isn't good coffee.  This is good coffee.<br \/><br \/>I rarely buy flavored coffees but figured I'd give the hazelnut decaf a try.  The flavor is quite nice and strong but not overpowering.  The beans seem to be of a very good quality and are roasted to what seems like a full city roast to me.  The coffee was also very fresh and this was something that I was concerned about prior to ordering.  Also, you probably would never guess that this was decaf, so it allows you to enjoy a flavored full-bodied coffee without some of the unpleasant side-effects associated with caffiene.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I feel that this is a five star product.  If you like the taste of hazelnuts paired with a full-bodied decaf coffee bean, I think that you would enjoy this.\",\"A_id\":118872,\"B_id\":543385,\"C_id\":407964}}"},

It had been a while since I had had any club soda, probably years.  I had been thirsty all day, and I thought this would quench my thirst.  Well that it certainly did - and more; I just cannot believe how good this club soda is each time I take a drink.  I am not sure exactly what it is that makes it so good.  Maybe it is that pinch of Himalayan salt they put in each bottle, or maybe they fill each bottle with as much carbonation as it can theoretically hold.  Whatever the reason, this beverage is good - I mean really good.  It has become my beverage of choice all day long (except in the morning when I revert to coffee).  This is one smooth club soda.  It is so refreshing.<br \/><br \/>So I got to thinking - other than the pinch of Himalayan salt, I really did not know the first thing about club soda.  Therefore, I did a little research.  Here is what I found out: Club soda goes by many names.  But mainly, it is merely carbonated water, also referred to as sparkling water or seltzer water.  However, believe me when I state that Q Club Soda is not just merely carbonated water.  I have been drinking a lot of club soda over the years, just by different names.  All this carbonated water is simply a concoction of carbon dioxide and water.  How simple is that.  This Q Club Soda is unique because of its maximum carbonation and that wonderful pinch of salt.  I am assuming that this Q Club Soda is so good because of the extra fizz and the salt from the region from whence the Yangtze flows.  Either way, I certainly would not want my Q Club Soda to be used for stain remover when spills occur on clothes.  That would be a waste.  I would use my Q Club Soda to relieve an upset stomach, with a touch of bitters.<br \/><br \/>Therefore, if you try Q Club Soda, I hope you like it.\",\"C\":\"Too Hot To Handle:\n I usually love everything and anything Wasabi but not these.

I suppose I could have tried warming them in the microwave to see if that altered the cookie some, but I didn't think of that.  They were not hard and crumbly, but not really moist either.  In the center was a chocolate concoction that wasn't really gooey and of course chocolate and white chocolate chips throughout the outside of the cookie.

I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.

If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br \/><br \/>In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.

They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br \/><br \/>Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey\/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br \/><br \/>I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO\/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey\/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br \/><br \/>Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br \/>Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br \/><br \/>I hope that this review is helpful!\",\"A_id\":116799,\"B_id\":318683,\"C_id\":96035}}"},

Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.<br \/><br \/>I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.<br \/><br \/>It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.<br \/><br \/>Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Pleasing for Ginger Lovers:\n If you like ginger, you will more than likely appreciate these ginger snaps from Newman's Own Organics.  Unlike many ginger snaps or other ginger-containing products, you not only taste the ginger in these cookies, but you can feel it, too.  Here are the particulars of my review:<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/><br \/>*  Real ginger taste - Even after just one cookie, I had that telltale spicy burn in my mouth unique to ginger.  In addition to ground ginger, these cookies contain bits of candied ginger large enough to chew on.  If you really love ginger, you'll probably like these cookies.  For those of you who are sensitive to the spice, these may be too much in my opinion.<br \/><br \/>*  Thick size - While not terribly large, about 1.5 inches across, these are fairly thick - about 1\/4 inch.  That makes them thicker than most ginger snaps I've run across and also satisfying to eat.  You don't feel cheated by having just one.<br \/><br \/>*  Ingredients - These are mostly made up of ingredients listed as organic on the label, though not all the ingredients are organic.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/><br \/>*  Palm oil - For those seeking to avoid this particular ingredient, this may be a drawback.  Saturated fat comes in at 1.5g and even though the palm fruit oil is listed as organic, it is the type of fat that may turn some people away.<br \/><br \/>*  Crunch - For this reviewer, these were a little too crunchy - even to the point of being jarring.  I was surprised initially and it reminded me of eating especially hard Corn Nuts or un-popped popcorn.  Maybe it is because they are so thick, or perhaps because they have been baked a little longer.  I could imagine that people with sensitive teeth could have a problem with these.<br \/><br \/>Other Thoughts:<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think these are good and tasty ginger snaps.  I happen to like ginger, so the strong ginger taste is fine by me.  That ginger spice burns lingers a good 15 minutes after eating these...<br \/><br \/>My main issue with these is how crunchy they are; perhaps I got a batch that got over-cooked, or maybe they will fine tune them as production continues.<br \/><br \/>So if you like ginger and you want to lean towards organics ingredients in your snacks, don't pass these up without giving them a try.\",\"B\":\"Yummy and won't make you ill:\n The Trail Mix Cookies are my favorite from Uncle Eddie's.

Partly because I had no idea how I got in the store (it was because I took an Ambien), but for the most part because I was having a hell of a time deciding which cereal to buy. I would reach out to grab a box and then stop halfway. A box would find its way into my cart and I would immediately put it back. At one point I even had four different types of cereal in my cart. No way I'm buying all these different cereals. There's just no way. While I'm saying this to myself, the stockboy is staring at me. Why did I ever decide to come in here with a robe on and slippers today? I thought to myself. My attire had undermined any wisp of non-creepiness I had when I entered the store. Time was not on my side, a choice had to be made. A crowd was starting to form. People were taking bets on what choice I was going to make. Okay, maybe that didn't really happen; I mistook the crowd for a mom with a bunch of kids that I saw from the corner of my eye. Nonetheless, I had to get home. I was hungry. I decided to just close my eyes and grab a box. After spinning around several times, I stuck my arm out and grabbed what felt like a big bag of marshmallows; it was an elderly woman's buttocks. She had apparently bent over in front of me to pick up a penny. I quickly tried to explain it was an honest mistake, however, she struck me with her purse before I could finish my explanation and take my hand off her bottom. Luckily, she hurried off soon after.  This was beginning to become a disaster. I needed cereal and I needed it fast. My neck was cranked, after the purse smack, to an area of the aisle I wasn't looking at before, and then I saw it: Honey Bunches of Oats. It had everything I was looking for in a cereal: the corn flakes, frosted flakes, almonds, crunchy clusters, and even some stuff I wasn't looking for, like granola oat things (which look like they are perfectly sized to block an unsuspecting windpipe). But most importantly, the cereal denotes healthiness, while it's actually not really all that healthy. I like that. Looks good in the pantry if someone sees it, but doesn't taste like wood chips. Isn't that what we're all looking for in a cereal? Unfortunately, before I could pick up a box the manager told me to leave. Long story short, I went home and bought this multi-pack on Amazon. It tastes like no cereal I have ever had before. And you know me, (edit: you probably don't), I've had a lot of cereal. If you are on the fence about trying this cereal, don't be. I think it was well worth the inadvertent old woman butt squeeze and getting banned from the store. But that's just me.<br \/><br \/>Lessons I learned:<br \/>Honey Bunches of Oats is awesome.<br \/>Going into the real world is overrated. Especially when MTV has a show called The Real World, which I can watch from the comfort of my own home. And let me tell ya, when people start getting real, it gets real, really quick.

The packaging is attactive, with instructions that are easy to follow for bread machines and conventional ovens.  You get a bag of the flour, a packet of yeast, and two packets of liquid sourdough starter.  I used my Zojirushi bread machine on the whole wheat setting, which usually works great.  Trial number 1: Made exactly according to package directions, the bread came out like an undercooked doughy rock.  While it did rise during the process, the last rise was minimal.  Usually a 1 1\/2 pound loaf bakes 7-8 high in my machine.  This one was barely 4 high, half of what is should be.  The taste was bitter and the herb flavors, including caraway, coriander, and fennel, were unpleasant.  Trial number 2:  I added an egg and an extra packet of yeast, plus 2 tsp of sugar, in an effort to help the bread rise more.  I also baked it for 10 minutes longer in the regular oven after the bread machine finished so it wouldn't be so doughy.  The result was no better than the first. The loaf was very heavy, bitter and taste, not good at all, inedible. Trial number 3:  This time I combined the package of Seitenbacher with half of a standard white bread recipe that works well in my machine (basic white bread: 1 5\/8 cup unbleached white flour, 1\/2 cup plus 1 T water, 1 T dry milk powder, 2 tsp sugar, 1\/2 tsp salt, and 1 packet of yeast).  I hoped that the combination of a lighter white bread with this dark heavy rye would help.  Well the resulting loaf did rise more, but only to about 7-8.  This is essentially 1 1\/2 time the usual recipe, so it should have risen to the top of the pan, 10-11 or more.  It's still very heavy, and the additional sugar did nothing to overpower the strong bitter flavor of this bread.  It did taste a little better with a lot of butter on it, but not enough to really enjoy it.  I had to convince myself I liked it, but I didn't.<br \/><br \/>Perhaps this style of bread is supposed to have a bitter flavor, but it's really unique in a negative way, and unlike any rustic sourdough rye I've ever had.  I'll be feeding my three experimental loaves to the birds.  I do wonder if the Seitenbacher German Farmers Bread without seeds would taste better or not, but it might also has the same herbs.\",\"C\":\"A little too sweet and sticky for me, but to each his own:\n the first thing I thought when I drank this juice was hmmm, this really tastes like those toxic drinks they used to make when I was a kid, when they didn't care\/know\/got sued for preservatives, sugar and artificial colors in drinks<br \/>which is cool, since we all miss those things we had when we were kids, but cant find them and even if we did wouldn't sacrifice our teeth and health for.<br \/><br \/>this drink however has no sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, artificial colors of gluten!<br \/>which is amazing considering the over-the-top sweetness and stickiness this juice has.<br \/>so, if you are into super sweet drinks that leave a sticky sensation in your mouth in a lightly carbonated form without the bad things in it - this one is for you.<br \/><br \/>I personally had to drink a glass of water after one can just to get rid of the stickiness in my mouth.<br \/>enjoy.\",\"A_id\":253702,\"B_id\":492435,\"C_id\":249454}}"},

I always thought coffee was watery before and never really liked it. I rcvd a Keurig Machine as a gift and the samples seemed watery, so I searched and found the reviews on Amazon. Based on those, I ordered the Timothys Midnight Magic. WOW, PERFECT is all I can say. My wife thinks it is way too bold, (but does agree out of all of my bold coffee's it is #1.) My friend tried it and the next week he had his own Keurig machine and Midnight Magic. I have at least 15-20 different types of k-cups in the cupboard, but my friends come over and always go past them to my Timothy's Midnight Magic. It is ridiculous, I tell them to drink the others so they will get used up before they get old, but to no avail. I will have to HIDE my Timothy's until the rest are gone!<br \/><br \/>We stayed in a cabin with some friends and I brought a huge bag of Keurig K-cups with me with a large varity ( I also had about 10-12 Midnight Magic's in there). I figured everyone would try different flavors. Didn't happen, the REAL coffee drinkers honed in on my Midnight Magic before I noticed, and drank ALL of them. They didn't know they were MY Special stash....... FOR ME! oh well. I don't know how they figured out the Midnight Magic so fast, but once they had one of them, that was it.<br \/><br \/>My wife loves the Gloria Jeans Coffee's - Toffee, Hazelnut, etc,,,,, and I will admit they smell great, just not enough flavor for me. I have also tried the Coffee People Black Tiger, (smells a little bitter) its OK, but I prefer the Timothy's Midnight Magic by a long shot. It has a very special after taste I have not been able to find anywhere else, and I love the smell of it. Rich, BOLD, flavor. I fill my cup with a small and then a medium using the same k-cup, and use half-n-half. (my friend drinks his Black and says it is perfect). I also like the Green Mountain Dark Magic and I can get those at the local Target store. (not as good as the Timothy's though, but still very good).<br \/><br \/>Hopes this helps. If you like a nice bold cup of coffee, but NOT bitter, with an aftertaste I can't describe but everyone loves, than this is it.<br \/><br \/>:)\",\"A_id\":4199,\"B_id\":22783,\"C_id\":540609}}"},

It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the store-bought name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br \/><br \/>Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br \/><br \/>Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br \/><br \/>People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?<br \/><br \/>I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br \/><br \/>Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br \/><br \/>Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br \/><br \/>Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br \/><br \/>Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br \/><br \/>Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br \/><br \/>Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel.

When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br \/><br \/>I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.

I like that you have the ability to break the standard package in half and carry around a smaller portion. This is nice for someone (like my husband) who doesn't want to put a large pack of gum in his pocket, or myself not wanting to carry a full size pack of gum in a small purse. I don't care for the fact that the packaging lacks the ability to conveniently dispose of your used gum in a wrapper like most other gums, but that's just the way of Dentyne gums. You have to find a tissue of a piece of paper if you're not near a trash can ;-) Otherwise, the Peppermint is by far my favorite flavor. I also reviewed the Arctic Chill, which is much too strong...I would not recommend it! But the peppermint is a nice flavor. Still strong, but not overwhelming.

Every month, I used to take LOADS of ibuprofen and pamprin for 3-4 days at a time so that I could function and go to work. I saw this in a health foods store and tried it, because I was desperate and it's cheap! I thought the benefits would be as a placebo, or the psychological comfort of drinking something warm when you're in pain. I was mistaken. I feel it actually does a great job of preparing my uturus for that time and keeping it relaxed and efficient when the time comes---meaning a lot of effective, natural pain relief.<br \/><br \/>How I use it: I start drinking 2-3 cups of tea per day beginning 3-5 days before my period starts, and then even more if I start cramping. The first day or two of my period, I might have 5-6 cups of tea. This tea TASTES GREAT (not medicine-like at all) and you really can't overdo it. I've been able to wean myself off the ibuprofen to where I'm not taking more than the labeled ibuprofen dosage (about 1\/4 of what I was using before). I don't suffer from prementrual symptoms (just agony during menstruation) but I have girlfriends who do and they swear this stuff works for that as well. Amazon has the best price anywhere.

I ended up with burnt, partially cooked gloop and a very messy iron griddle. The second day I tried to match the directions on the box as carefully as possible, and added extra oil to the griddle. The pancakes turned out better, but still stuck to the cooking surface. What seemed to help the most was keeping the heat very low. This morning I tried making them again, with results similiar to the second batch. I will not use this brand again, because I prefer to add berries to my pancakes, and it takes way too long to scrape the burnt bits off my iron griddle!<br \/><br \/>As far as flavor goes, these have a sweet vanilla note without being cloying (which I liked), but they taste strongly of baking powder.

Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk.

The first, <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B007RTR9G0>CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce<\/a>, is not a shampoo product so I've reviewed it separately. The other products are different formulations of a men's dandruff shampoo:<br \/><br \/><a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B007JT7AGC>CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce<\/a><br \/><a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B007K449EC>CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner, 12.9 Fluid Ounce<\/a><br \/><a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B007K449CE>CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce<\/a><br \/><br \/>DH has fine, straight, fast-growing, oily hair and really flaky scalp. I have very fine, curly, dry hair with itchy but not as flaky scalp. (I'm trying to woo DH away from the Head and Shoulders, which has dyes and chemicals that the Clear shampoo does not.) The Clear shampoo appears to have the same active anti-dandruff ingredients as Head and Shoulders, but it also has some very nice scalp-nourishing oils and vitamins. In my comparisons below, I'm going to focus more on the different feel of the different types of shampoo and how they leave my hair feeling because the anti-dandruff effects are going to be cumulative across all of them.<br \/><br \/>I tried the Cool Sport Mint first, and it's what I used to knock back the oilness of the Ultra Shea oil (see my review). The fragrance is for men, but it's not a strong fragrance. It smells just fine on a woman! The mintyness is mild. I lathered up and let the shampoo absorb into my scalp for a few minutes (it felt good!), then did what I typically do with my shampoo...spread as much of it over my upper body as I could scoop off my head to save on soap before rinsing. The mint shampoo felt quite invigorating on my skin, more so than on my head, but not as much as Dr. Bronner's Peppermint. I like the way this Cool Mint shampoo feels. After using it, my scalp felt a little less itchy. It didn't do much for my dry hair, however, but it did leave it pretty soft.<br \/><br \/>The next formulation I tried was the 2-in-1 shampoo\/conditioner. That worked with my own hair better but probably would not be as good for someone with oily hair (like DH). It has just enough softening power to untangle my curls and leave them soft without weighting them down like some conditioners do. After just three uses of these two Clear shampoos, my scalp feels a lot better.<br \/><br \/>I am still waiting to receive the Strong & Full product, so I will chime in with how it compares to the others when\/if it comes. It looks from the ingredients list that many of the ingredients are the same as the products I already have, but it seems to be designed more for oily hair. Maybe by the time it comes, DH's bottle of Head and Shoulders will be gone and I can get his opinion on it.<br \/><br \/>Now, the last thing I'm going to say about these Clear shampoos is that I just love the packaging: a handsome designer-looking bottle. The design of the cap requires only a quick press of the thumb to flick open the lid to squirt\/pour, and another quick flick to close it. You can, with some effort, remove the cap if you want to refill it with something when it's empty. (I don't like to buy anything in plastic unless I can reuse it for something, and this bottle is going to be perfect for filling up with dishwashing liquid that I buy in large containers at Costco plus other non-food liquids of shampoo-like consistency. Tempera paints, maybe.) The company even thoughtfully provided labels that stay on well but that you can fairly easily and cleanly remove just by getting them started and then peeling them off in one big piece&mdash;so when the shampoo is gone, you don't have an ugly branded or sticky bottle.<br \/><br \/>The bottle is #7 plastic, however, which means the plastic was invented after 1987, and it's not recommended to put any foodstuffs into it. Like some other plastics, some #7 plastics release BPA; however, many medical and dental appliances are made of #7 plastic so I'm not going to worry about it if I'm using it for cleaning products.\",\"A_id\":415235,\"B_id\":35077,\"C_id\":72038}}"},

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Marvelous, especially with added lemon juice:\n I'm a water drinker and I still drink a lot of it straight from the filter. But water can get boring...it is nice to occasionally use an enhancer to add some zest. At various times, I've tried all the commercial products out there. None come close to matching the flavor and convenience of MiO. This is truly an original and outstanding product and it has become a regular part of my food life.<br \/><br \/>I'm an extremely health-conscious eater. I eat a mostly plant-based diet of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. I grow a large portion of my own veggies and buy the rest from local farmers' markets. I try to avoid processed food and cook almost everything from scratch. MiO's ingredient list shows artificial colors, sweeteners, and preservatives...so you might wonder why would I even consider drinking it. Well, I don't use that much and I don't worry about this one little misdemeanor in my pantry. My diet is so healthy in so many other ways that I consider MiO a small indulgence.<br \/><br \/>I've tried to go natural with water enhancers--for example adding pomegranate juice. But truthfully, it is not nearly as flavorful and far from convenient or cost-effective.<br \/><br \/>What I frequently do use to make my MiO drink more healthful is to squeeze a real half a lemon into it. The artificial sugars used in MiO are so strong that they sweeten the lemon, too...and the lemon enhances all the MiO flavors. Lemon is extremely healthful! I could fill up this review page with medical and nutritional information showing the beneficial qualities of lemon juice. I've known about this for a long time but rarely fixed lemonade for myself because I dread using all the real or artificial sugars that it needs to take away the intense sourness. The artificial sugars used in MiO are 600 times sweeter than sugar...they do the trick with a little squirt and nothing more added. So, by using MiO with a half a lemon squeezed into it, I find that I am drinking more liquid per day than I did before I discovered MiO and I am incorporating lemon juice into my daily diet. In the balance, MiO has been a health improvement.<br \/><br \/>Yes, I am aware of the propylene glycol used in this product...but it does not cause me great concern. I am more fearful of coming into contact with bad chemicals from insecticides, common home cleaning products, factory-farmed meat and fish, and the tons of processed foods that I avoid when cooking my own meals from scratch.<br \/><br \/>Taste is a matter of individual preference. I keep all the flavors on hand for variety's sake, but seem to prefer the Berry Pomegranate and the Mango Peach.<br \/><br \/>The MiO bottle is a marvelous invention that should win some kind consumer prize. There is a double-locking lid and little membrane over the opening.

Needless to say, my son came home with a full pouch of this, an empty pouch of carrots, and a note saying that he absolutely refused to eat this.

On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.<br \/><br \/>A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001CHFUDC>Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)<\/a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.<br \/><br \/>ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002APWQ0K>Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups<\/a><br \/><br \/>ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00196QVPM>Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee<\/a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing).\",\"A_id\":521136,\"B_id\":488007,\"C_id\":535797}}"},

The expresso pull was disappointing, no creme, just the taste of old coffee.  As you might bet, the return policy is no returns.  So, this gets to join the compost pile.

The lid is a bit difficult to get off, but that shows you the delicate eggs are protected.  You know when your Jello wants to stick in the mold, so you stick a table knife between the Jello and the mold to let air in, then the Jello mold pops right out?  Well, do this with this tin.  I stick a knife or fork up under the top of the tin in three or four place to let air in, then the lid comes off without too much trouble.  I will purchase this again in the future.  Simply awesome.\",\"A_id\":513585,\"B_id\":222752,\"C_id\":253281}}"},

I first found the Illy brand in the airport in Germany and the line was long.  I now understand why.<br \/><br \/>It also has that classic Illy taste.  Not too much bite or bitterness.  The Illy espresso is 100% arabica beans made from producing countries.  It is very smooth.  One added bonus, I can take the grinds out to my garden to help my soil.

We had two 20 years old, one 18 year old and two 4 years old.  Our 3 oldest all had to be put down during the last year from various ailments relating to their ages and one of the 4 years old we lost to cancer in spite of an operation and two chemo treatments.  It was a sad year.  They all loved Purina Cat Chow Naturals and seemed to thrive on it.  In June of this year we made a move to Roatan in the Bay Islands of Honduras and of course Mikey came with us. When we first got here we were pleased to find the Purina Naturals on the shelves of two of our 4 Supermarkets but then it disappeared (maybe we bought it all).  We started feeding our two cats (We adopted Paco on the island)something else and Mikey would occasionally throw up and neither of them seemed overly fond of their new food.  Of course Paco would eat anything because he was starving when we found him.  I finally ordered two 15lb. bags of the Naturals from Amazon and it arrived about 3 weeks later.  I'm happy to say that they both dived into it and Mikey likes it better than his wet food.  Their coats are both shiny and they both seem to be thriving.  It's not cheap to have 30 lbs. of Cat food shipped from the States, but well worth it.  Maybe someone from Purina could talk to the local Supermarkets and have them start ordering again.  They couldn't keep it on the shelves it sold so rapidly.  Maybe that's why they stopped handling it (a local joke).  Anyway, I highly recommend it.\",\"A_id\":404464,\"B_id\":233694,\"C_id\":330325}}"},

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Very Rich and Dark:\n Every Starbucks coffee I've ever tried brews up so strong and dark that I always have to reduce the amount of coffee from what the directions recommend (usually by as much as half.) This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect. First off, I must admit that I really don't care much for flavored coffees as I prefer actual coffee-flavored coffee. I also use a standard, automatic-drip machine (think Mr. Coffee), so I guess I'm not expert. But I do drink coffee daily and I love a good cup of rich, smooth coffee with a little real cream added. If you like your coffee VERY strong, brew this one according to package directions. I brewed it with half of the recommended amount and mixed in some Folger's decaf to round it out. You may be surprised to know that the result was a still-very-strong coffee (that some folks in my house wanted to dilute with water) that was smooth and tasty with just the right touch of vanilla. My husband drank it black and said it was fine but his only requirement of coffee is that it be strong, so this fit the bill. I added my usual cream and a distinctly unusual half-teaspoon of sugar. The result was a delicious, smooth, creamy coffee with a kick of sweet vanilla. Although I'm still no big fan of sweet or flavored coffee, I give this a big thumbs-up for taste.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"One of my favorite fats:\n Given that we are living in a time when (at least in the US) we are told that fats in our diets are bad for us, it is a real pleasure to find an item like this.  I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br \/><br \/>I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br \/><br \/>I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.  Other than that I must say that this is a staple for me and a great addition to any pantry (when used reasonably, of course).\",\"B\":\"Not satisfied:\n Quite disappointed.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"Almost perfect... but...:\n Ok, well first I should say that I have very little experience with GF products, because I was just recently diagnosed with gluten sensitivity.  And I have zero experience making pizza.  That said, I have both positive and negative feedback about this product.<br \/><br \/>Just today I made my first-ever pizza, with this GF crust.  As it was nearly 100 degrees today, I didn't want to heat my oven to 425, so I decided to make it on the grill outdoors instead.  I sprayed oil on the down-facing side, just to keep it from sticking to the grill grate.  On the stoptove, I sauteed ground sirloin (93% lean), red and yellow bell peppers, some Vidalia onion, and sliced Baby Bella mushrooms in some olive oil and chopped garlic.  When finished cooking that, I drained it on paper towels to remove the excess oil.  Then I piled them onto a pizza crust and topped it all with grated cheddar cheese.  These were all just odds and ends that I had leftover from other meals I cooked this past weekend.<br \/><br \/>Then I put it on the grill on medium heat, and watched it carefully.  I checked it in five or so minutes, and it had started to brown a little.  I lowered the heat to low and cooked it for a few more minutes, then checked it again.  It was brown and had nice grill marks on it, so I took it off and sliced off a piece to taste it.  It seemed like it was cooked just fine... soft and doughy on the inside, nice and brown and crispy on the outside.  I determined that it was ready to eat, so I took it off and polished it off... yummy and soooo filling.  That will definitely be my only meal today.  It was delicious, and the crust tasted fine.  I think that my hubby would even like it.<br \/><br \/>Now the negatives.  But these are more a matter of personal taste than anything specifically wrong with the crusts themselves.  First, I should've checked the label before eating it, because I am also lactose intolerant.  I can handle a small amount of lactose (the cheese I used contained almost none), but I didn't realize until I'd eaten it that the crust contained milk.  Whoops.  So here comes the bloating...  maybe a better warning on the front of the box not lactose free would be good.  I don't know why I assumed it was, I shouldn't have assumed that.  I notice that even I write this review, one of the suggested tags for it is casein free.  It says right in the ingredients that it contains milk protein, so people allergic or sensitive to casein shouldn't eat it.<br \/><br \/>Second, if you are counting carbs to lose weight, it is not a great idea to eat an entire crust by yourself.  These look like single-serving pizzas... they are small and I treated it as if it were a personal pizza.  However, the label says that 1\/3 of the crust contains 30g of carbs.  Yikes.  So I just consumed 90g of carbs in one sitting.  That's not good for me or probably for anyone.  These crusts are fairly thick too, and I normally like a thin, crispy pizza crust.  I would love these much better if they were 1\/2 the thickness and 1\/2 the carbs.<br \/><br \/>Finally, these come with holes pricked on one side but not the other.  Being new to making my own pizza, I wasn't quite sure which side went down and which went up.  Some instructions on the box to this effect would benefit pizza-making novices like myself.  In the end, I put the hole-side down, but in retrospect I think maybe that was wrong.  Maybe the holes are meant to allow steam to escape upwards, so the crust gets crispy.  Anyone who can give me some insight on this will be appreciated! (At any rate, my crust did come out perfect so maybe I got it right.) I've cooked pretty much everything in my lifetime, but somehow never got into pizza.  Now that I am gluten intolerant, I hope to be making my own and eventually get real good at it.  My goal is to make a gluten-free pizza that even my hubby will find irresistible...and maybe even preferable to the pizza shop kind.  However, even though this crust was good, I can't see myself eating it regularly because of the carbs.  Most likely, I will learn to make my own GF crust so that I can make it as thin, crispy, lactose-free, casein-free, and gluten-free as I like.\",\"B\":\"FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain Tortilla Chips, 1.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24:\n These chips are great.

While this still isn't the healthiest food out there, you can satisfy your milk chocolate craving without the guilt you'd get from eating a Hershey's bar.<br \/>Besides eating it straight, it works perfectly as dessert toppings and drizzles.  It's incredibly creamy and sweet, you'd never guess it's sugar free.<br \/>It works great in fudge: [...]<br \/>It also works great in chocolate molds: [...]\",\"A_id\":276621,\"B_id\":403271,\"C_id\":503178}}"},

I recommend it for a quick lunch to go with your favorite<br \/>tofu dish.\",\"B\":\"Never a fan of macadamias...until now:\n A friend brought these back from Hawaii.  They are OUTSTANDING.  Good enough that I found them on Amazon and ordered some more, even though they cost 3x what he paid on the islands.\",\"C\":\"Honey Beef sticks in saddlebag packaging:\n I like this product very much. The Honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others I've seen. The saddlebag package is ingenious. why open and expose to the air all 100 when you only have to open half at a time. leave one half (50) completely sealed. One package of 100 thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time. Use for emergency shelters,mountain climbing ,backpacking, camping, hiking, survival training, or any survival situation.theres plenty (100), so you could sustain yourself a long time if lost.Just these very light storable beefsticks and a jar of peanut butter unopened and a large jug of water in a vehicle could sustain life for a very long time at a minimum of space and weight.They appear kind of home made, unlike any beef sticks I have seen in stores before. My dogs like them also.I break off 1\/2pieces whenever they need a treat. I see nothing in the ingredients that suggest dogs can't eat them.However I want each person to evaluate this on their own not just because I say so. My 5 dogs have had pieces of them now and then and love them and havent shown any signs of being sick or having less energy. I recommend them.\",\"A_id\":256274,\"B_id\":461406,\"C_id\":4943}}"},
{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"You will love this mix:\n I bought this mix on a visit to the south and really loved it. It is not available in my area so I am glad to find it on Amazon. A quick, easy dinner can be ready in 30-40 minutes. It is very tasty if you make it as the box suggests but,even better if before adding the mix, you add some fresh onion, celery, and green pepper and saute lightly with the meat - the jambalaya will taste like you made it from scratch. Like most packaged mixes, it is a bit salty; you probably should be cautious if you are on a low sodium diet.\",\"B\":\"meh... not a fave, prefer the other blonde:\n When Starbucks came out with the blonde roasts, I got pretty excited because I prefer lighter roasts (as do 40% of coffee drinkers, according to the barista at the store)... light roasts are a little earthier, not as burnt tasting.  So I scored a bag each of the Willow and Veranda.<br \/><br \/>This one, the Veranda, didn't do a lot for us.  Subjectively speaking, it was so smooth it was boring... it had no snap, and was kind of mixed and mushy, not a definitive flavor.  It's supposed to have delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts - really?  We missed that.<br \/><br \/>On the other hand, we really liked the Willow, which had a brighter citrus-y note and was more flavorful.  The taste was (for lack of better words) clear, defined.  You buy a light roast to taste the bean, not the roast.  The Willow was flavorful, not acidy, and had a clean finish.<br \/><br \/>Your tastes may vary, but if you like a snappy light roast, or a breakfast roast the Veranda probably won't be your pick, but do try the Willow.\",\"C\":\"Good flavor delivers a nice morning jolt.:\n I tried Vitamin Squeeze this morning as an alternative to my usual caffeinated and carbonated morning beverage.  It has a nice fruit punch flavor, and very little after taste.  I followed the directions of one squirt per eight ounces of water, and was rewarded with a light flavor that was not overpowering.  I imagine that you could increase your squirts if you wanted more fruity goodness, but one squirt seemed about right for me.<br \/><br \/>Vitamin Squeeze was a good eye opener for the morning, and it made me feel good to know I was getting all of those vitamins!  This is a nice product that is easy to use and is one that I will be purchasing in the future.\",\"A_id\":487371,\"B_id\":94968,\"C_id\":543855}}"}]
