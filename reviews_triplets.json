I was happy to see they did in a multi-pack but was appalled to see how much they were. They are only $.28 at Walmart so for a pack of 12, only $3.36. Even with the subscribe and save, it's more than double the price on here. Very disappointing!\",\"B\":\"<b>Low acid but lacks flavor:<br \\\/> <\/b>Normally, if it's got the word gourmet in it, my back stiffens up. It's a label often slapped onto an over priced product to attract the those that will eat\/drink anything with the word on gourmet because they think it makes them look cool and hip. And it usually doesn't taste what I would consider gourmet. So, I confess, I started reviewing this with a bias against it - high price and labeled gourmet.<br \/><br \/>With only a one pot sample to work with, I didn't have a chance to try differing brewing methods. I went with my typical coffee making method, drip brew. It smelled nice, looked pretty dark. The taste is very hard to explain. While it has a full flavor, that flavor is of...weak coffee. I thought I'd botched the brew, but when I compared the color and opacity against my normal stuff, the Puroast looked identical. It just tasted like the same near see through stuff one gets at a greasy spoon restaurant, gas station,IHOP, etc. While not vile, it wasn't for me. I prefer a darker, richer taste.<br \/><br \/>That being said, the big deal about Puroast is that it's low acid. That I will say I definitely noticed. Not even a hint of tummy twisting, even though I intentionally drank it on an empty stomach. For those that have problems with acid, and don't mind (or maybe even like) the taste of weak coffee, it's worth a try at least. Given the price, I'd suggest you get as little as possible to try though.\",\"C\":\"<b>Smooth and refreshing:<br \\\/> <\/b>I love water and this water tastes great and is extra smooth.

So, it is not surprising that this water actually has a small bit of bicarbonate of soda in the ingredients. This water has no after taste and is smooth and refreshing. It may be even better for hydrating because of the 9.5 pH. I would purchase this product in the future.\",\"A_id\":448625,\"B_id\":23168,\"C_id\":496771}}"},

I stayed at my buddies house and we made a trip to Costco.  One of the items that he picked up was a case of Ito En Green Tea in a can, yes I said can.  Being that it is always hot in Hawaii I was excited about trying this drink.<br \/><br \/>We left the tea in his fridge over night and the next morning I opened my first can.  It was surprisingly good.  I would say it has a medium bodied taste that is very, very smooth.  The colder it is, the better.  I liked it so much, that's all I drank on my 2 week vacation.  I actually drank so much, I had to keep going back to Costco to buy more.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, I come back to California and the first thing I do is go to Costco hoping they have this tea.  Sadly, they don't carry any non-sweetened teas in the store.  It became painfully obvious how much soda, juice and sweetened drinks everyone drinks around here.  Since I am a huge Amazon user, I searched and found this version of the tea in a bottle.  No cans to be found on Amazon.  I was worried it might not taste as good, but ordered the case anyway.<br \/><br \/>To my relief, the plastic bottled version tastes just about as good as the can version.  I've always preferred aluminum cans over plastic bottles, but I'll take what I can get.  If the can version is a 10, then the plastic bottled version is a 9.5.

Also, they do not last anywhere near an hour, more like 15-20 min., so just be warned, and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth.

The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.<br \/><br \/>I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips Ahoy cookies in the oven, yet.  :)<br \/><br \/>These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.<br \/><br \/>Given that the chocolate fudge is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.<br \/><br \/>I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.

I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br \/><br \/>Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br \/><br \/>I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe.\",\"B\":\"<b>Very Good!:<br \\\/> <\/b>I originally ordered these for my sister in law, but we found they would be perfect for my mother in law who lives alone, and honey crystalizes so fast when you don't use it enough, but the flavor is really good, I tried some in my tea first day and I Loved it and plan on ordering some more :)This seems to be the only safe one (some of the foreign honey granules have a cancer warning - this one does not) thats why we picked this brand.\",\"C\":\"<b>Great tasting:<br \\\/> <\/b>Used this to make a batch of homemade root beer with the kids.

When it came time to move my 6 month old into solids, I wanted to home make his food also. But since I have less time and freezer space, batch cooking just wasn't feasible. I wanted to make his foods from the ingredients I was using for the family meals. Trying to puree small amounts in a regular size blender or processor is impossible. I saw this and though it would make meal time easier - and it does!<br \/><br \/>Now the baby eats what we are eating, just steamed and pureed. I can make 3-4 servings at a time and just put the extras in singe serve containers in the fridge. I cooked a whole chicken, pulled off the meat and out it into small snack sized bags and put them in the freezer. Now while I am cooking for the older kids, I put one serving of chicken, with some veggies and\/or fruit in the cooker and it cooks away while I am making dinner for the rest if the family. E.A.S.Y.<br \/><br \/>-The mold issue other reviewers shouldn't be a problem, if you make sure the reservoir is empty and  leave the top off so that it can air dry. Same for the blender\/steamer parts. Just dry them between uses. I use water from my Brita to reduce build up between descaling. If your reservoir in a regular steamer isn't emptied all the way, it will do the same thing.<br \/><br \/>-The counter top footprint is small, about \u00be of the size of my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. It's small and does small amounts, it doesn't say that it does large batches. So I'm confused as to how people are disappointed that it doesn't do large batches. It states it has a 2 \u00bd cup bowl.<br \/><br \/>-The Beaba website sells the replacement parts all separately which I liked, just in case something needs replacing.  I cook a lot and have has to replace blades on my large processor, so I'm glad that the parts are so easy to get.<br \/><br \/>-The steamer does shut off automatically and the light goes off, but just like a regular steamer, if you leave food over boiling water, it will continue to soften. The booklet gives you the times for the steamer, so timing it is actually pretty easy. (Level 1 on the bowl is 7 minutes, level 2 is 10 minutes, level 3 is 15 minutes).<br \/><br \/>-The Beaba website has more free recipes. (My kiddos fav is 2\/3 pumpkin, 1\/3 pear and a dash of pumpkin pie spice)<br \/><br \/>-The blender part worked great for my 6 month old, totally pureed the pumpkin, carrot, sweet potato, pear, nectarine, banana and butternut squash that I pureed in there. I thinned with water or pear juice.<br \/><br \/>-You hold the switch to the right to puree the food. For me, it's not a big deal to hold a switch for 30-60 seconds. So I don't see this as a design flaw.<br \/><br \/>-The top and bottom don't line up perfectly - they can't or else too much pressure would build up in the steamer and it would pressure cook the food, not steam it.<br \/><br \/>In short, This is my 3rd baby that I've cooked for at home, and I love this. Some of the design flaws others talked about aren't really flaws at all. I have to cook a meal for the kids at 5 and one for my hubby and I at 7 when he gets home.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"<b>SUPER HEALTHY DOG FOOD AT GREAT PRICE!:<br \\\/> <\/b>My toy poodles are older now and some are losing teeth so I have to go to canned dog food to supplement their Bil-Jac. They really loved the Happy Hips and Canidae Dog Food and they are great but  I was looking for something as good for them but also a little more cost effective since I have so many poodles...11 of them!  Good thing they are well mannered and trained!<br \/><br \/> A case of 24 cans of CS For The DLS  is the price of most cases of 12 cans with other brands. The ingredients are top notch with this one too. [...]<br \/><br \/>One of my tinniest ones, Baby Doll,  gets so excited  and lets out one big yelp whenever we pop open the top tab then she does this little dance around on her back two feet.  It is so cute! I also like that these cans have the pop top lid so I do not have to use the can opener.  I know, the epitome of laziness!  It is a nice feature though.<br \/><br \/>The 4-5 lb. dogs get mostly all can dog food now as their teeth are sooo little.  This canned dog food is specially formulated for seniors but I would guess from reading the ingredients, it could be for all ages. does not have lots of watery juice to take up space but more of a soft\/solid form. My larger dogs, up to 12 lbs get mostly the  Bil-Jac mixed with canned.  I mix about half a can with a little water to their Bil-Jac dry food and they graze and eat it up as they feel like it.  This keeps them in shape. They tend not to over eat when they know food is always available. I have always fed my dogs this way and it has always worked. I am going to add glucosamine to it for their hips as a few have problems with hips at their old age.  It is easy to do, just google correct dosage for them then crumble pills and add. Since I have so many dogs, I mix (hide) all meds in a teaspoon with the canned dog food and give it to them individually.<br \/><br \/>I would also like to say that if you have small dogs and \/or dogs with problem with their teeth, it is difficult for them to chew the harder kibble. If this happens they will just quit eating except when absolutely necessary and do harm to their health due to tooth pain. Bil-Jac is the only food I have found in dry form with the tiny kibbles which are easily crumbled. There are also dog aspirin formulas you can add, sneak in, to canned food for pain. Don't use unbuffered aspirin for dogs as it is hard on their stomachs. I also add Dr. Katz's water additive to prevent and help tooth and gum problems.<br \/><br \/>My dogs are on an antibiotic regimen ounce a month, first 10 days of month, to help prevent infection from gum disease.  They also have allergies. I was using Benedryl ( at Vet's recommendation) but after researching Zyrtec (generic form), for dogs, I am using that and it works wonders for their allergies. All of the a things I give my dogs are  available on Amazon for a fraction of the price at the drug store.<br \/><br \/> Please, if you are going to use Benedryl , Zyrtec or any other medication on your dog and cannot afford to go to to the vet, research it completely before doing so and make sure you have the dosage down carefully so you do not harm, or even kill, your pet. It is a very serious undertaking to medicate your dog on your own but can be of tremendous benefit to your pet if you know what you are doing, so research, research, research before doing it!<br \/><br \/>You may ask why I don't take my dogs to the vet for tooth cleaning.  Well, their  are several reasons; one the cost, of course, but the most important is that I do not want my little ones subjected to anesthesia once a year as it is dangerous, hard on their hearts and can cause other problems and even death.  I just make sure they are as pain free and as comfortable as possible in their later years, now.<br \/><br \/>Sorry, I got a little side-tracked!<br \/><br \/>Anyway, I highly recommend this dog food.  I am grateful the price is so reasonable so I can afford to feed my dogs this good food.<br \/><br \/>Blessings!\",\"B\":\"<b>Love It !:<br \\\/> <\/b>Starbucks Sumatra and Peets really are the best.

It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br \/><br \/>Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character Beetlejuice- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br \/><br \/>It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife\/mother of a family who moves into a haunted house inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br \/><br \/>Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br \/><br \/>Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br \/><br \/>Overall, a unique and entertaining film.

I began my taste testing with the medium roast Java: Using a drip coffee maker, I used a slightly rounded tablespoon and 12 oz of filtered water in a clean drip coffee maker. The result was a beefy, highly competitive coffee-like drink, very much like the real thing. A rounded tsp of sugar and very little cream was all I needed to make this a respectable alternative to coffee. That's saying a lot for me; before I ditched  coffee, about 8 years ago, I used 3 to 4 tsp of sugar per mug and lots of cream.  This drink doesn't need that: It would actually be very easy for me to learn to drink this black. If, however, your palate is stuck on high-test-coffee-only mode, don't even THINK about trying this; it's NOT coffee, but this particular flavor is definitely running a close second. On the other hand, if you're trying to wean yourself off caffeine, do buy this Java and make a blend of 3\/4 coffee and 1\/4 Java -- and gradually increase the Java portion until you have completely eliminated the coffee.

My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br \/><br \/>The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br \/><br \/>The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br \/><br \/>Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it. [...]Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber.

This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br \/><br \/>While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website. [...] Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6\/7\/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference!

Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts dancing on her two back legs.

The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the modern Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for hill), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the cream in between.<br \/><br \/>Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br \/><br \/>But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br \/><br \/>These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees).  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.\",\"A_id\":89394,\"B_id\":566438,\"C_id\":468403}}"},

Other flavors run about $2, plus or minus, and make either a gallon or half gallon.<br \/><br \/>Most important, they are unsweetened, leaving it to the customer to provide any extra sugar desired.  This is, of course, crucial for those trying to control their sugar intake, simply as calory control or because of diabetes, hyperactivity or other conditions.  But also it allows one to avoid the oversweetness of so many bottled juices on grocery store shelves, either due to the sugary apple \/ grape juice base or even added sweeteners.  If you choose to try any of the Da Fruta juices, I'd suggest you start with no added sugar and gradually add a few spoonfuls at a time (to that gallon or half gallon, not per serving!) until you reach your comfort zone.  I've been leaning toward the little-if-any sugar end of the spectrum lately, and find the result very refreshing and thirst quenching.  Of the two products I have in hand at the moment, the passion fruit has 2 g of sugars per serving (19 servings per container), and the cashew has 3 g of sugars.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, I don't have freshly squeezed juices to compare these concentrates with, nor even any other equivalent products (such as bottled whole or frozen concentrate).  They are nothing like the heavily sweetened canned nectars that are available in some groceries.  Considered on their own, they are flavorful, tart and refreshing, and allow you to mix to the strength and sweetness desired.\",\"A_id\":359350,\"B_id\":220756,\"C_id\":382574}}"},

NO one could believe how bright green and beautifully formed the plant was.  The fact that it had spent a few days in a sealed box was doubly mystifying!  This birthday present was paraded up an down the halls of our office building before it ever made it home to my husband.  Everyone was amazed.  Thank you for a great birthday surprise.  I hope we can take as good care of this gem as you did getting it to me.\",\"A_id\":332494,\"B_id\":132481,\"C_id\":215637}}"},

While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br \/><br \/>So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!\",\"C\":\"<b>Pleasant-tasting all-natural product:<br \\\/> <\/b>We had The Peacock brand vermicelli for dinner last night. In most respects it seems to be like most other vermicelli I've eaten, and I mean that in a good way. Easy to prepare (just follow the directions), and the taste was pleasant. If the price was competitive compared to other vermicelli I'd buy this without hesitation, but taste-wise there is nothing about it that makes it stand out from similar products I have eaten. If you're looking for an all-natural vermicelli product I think you'll be pleased with this.<br \/><br \/>The main attraction here is the product's ingredients list: brown rice, sago starch, and water. It's advertised as being all natural, and I think that qualifies! No chemicals. Compare that to a Korean brand of vermicelli, which also contains things like Xanthan Gum, Sodium Alginate, and Malic Acid. So the Peacock brand is a product you'll want to use if you're worried about eating an engineered food with added chemicals.<br \/><br \/>Compared to the Korean brand, the Peacock brand has a slightly higher fat and sodium content, and a lower iron content. I don't think this is a big deal unless you have to keep a close watch of your fat, sodium, or iron intake.<br \/><br \/>The nutrition information indicates a single package makes 3.5 servings. My wife was of the opinion it actually makes 4 decent-sized servings. You'll want to have something else with it though, as once serving of noodles isn't going to fill you up for long.\",\"A_id\":295331,\"B_id\":256905,\"C_id\":138960}}"},

The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br \/><br \/>I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life\/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br \/><br \/>The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br \/><br \/>I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br \/><br \/>We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system.\",\"C\":\"<b>Great Snack:<br \\\/> <\/b>These nuts are excellent, just a light glaze to sweeten tham a bit!\",\"A_id\":453494,\"B_id\":129554,\"C_id\":153453}}"},

Ever since I've been trying to cut coffee out of my diet completely (cause of teeth coloring), I started to drink at least 3-4 cups in the morning to rehydrate and get my caffeine kick, and 3-4 more cups throughout the rest of the day. That being said, I never previously found a tea mixture that I could drink for more than 3 days in a row at a time.<br \/><br \/>I've been on a life long hunt for a tea that's a little fruity without extra calories, actually tastes a little fruity, smells\/tastes delicious, and gives me a slight caffeine kick.<br \/><br \/>Now, before I go onto my rave about my love for this tea, this tea is not for everyone. If you're not really into the blueberry tasting thing, this is definitely not for you. My office smells like fruity blueberriness when I make this tea (luckily my coworkers don't mind it and enjoy it).<br \/><br \/>I previously tried other fruity teas but found they 1) didn't taste like the fruit even in the slightest bit, 2) only had an amazing scent but no amazing taste, or 3) had some taste of the fruit but left an awful bitter taste in my mouth.<br \/><br \/>In. comes. Yogi's Green Tea Blueberry Slim Tea. I have to be honest. I did not buy this for the slimming effects. I bought it for the promise of the blueberry taste. This is the only tea that fits exactly what I was looking for. I bought this 6 pack thing and zoomed through it within 2.5 months flat. Yikes. And this was with me doing my best to not use more than 3 tea bags a day (several times I broke and went through 5 a day :[[[ ). I loved it that much. Still love it.

I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf.<br \/><br \/>Kombucha tea is my second favorite Yogi green tea. The flavors added are natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The flavors are mild and pleasant however and this tea has the added health benefits of Kombucha but so does the Rejuvenation tea, which has this same ingredient in it.<br \/><br \/>Slim Life tea is very good- Amazingly good compared to diet green tea pills! I do not ever feel the side effects of a diet pill with this tea and I drink a lot of it being I got 6 boxes from Amazon. I think it's a wonderful tea but I'd prefer it if the natural blueberry flavor was left out. It does taste natural and sweet but mixed with Green tea, I'd prefer the lemon or peach flavors myself. If you do love the flavor of berry in your tea, you will love this one and it is mild and pleasant to drink all day long.<br \/><br \/>The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I preferred the best.

If you remember a product from the past called POSTUM, CAFIX tastes exactly like this. Whether or not it has a good taste is very subjective. I recently bought the CAFIX because I am trying to stop drinking coffee, but honestly, there is no comparison between the two. Many may love CAFIX right from the start, some may dislike it, some may absolutely hate it. One thing is for sure: CAFIX is a healthier alternative to coffee and if you do not like the taste and can figure out some sweeteners to make it palatable, then by all means, go for it. This is precisely what I am doing. I do not particularly care for the taste of CAFIX, but am going to try to let it grow on me over time, because coffee makes me too hyper, and is generally not a healthful beverage, although obviously it quite the favorite among millions of people.

I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br \/><br \/>The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a Bold k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br \/><br \/>So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right.\",\"C\":\"<b>Yum-yum!:<br \\\/> <\/b>I use applesauce, too, instead of the oil, and I always add grated carrot and zucchini.

Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br \/><br \/>Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.<br \/><br \/>All that said, taste is pretty good and the wet packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).\",\"C\":\"<b>What happened amazon?:<br \\\/> <\/b>$6.75 a box?

The worst part is when you open the bag, it smells horribly of FISH- GROSS! I almost gagged. I rinsed them and cooked them in a pan with a little olive oil, cracked black pepper, fresh garlic to try and mask the smell, some parmesan cheese & tomatoes.

The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br \/><br \/>When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br \/><br \/>At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br \/><br \/>As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br \/><br \/>Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering.

I brewed it 3 ways: vacuum, press, drip.<br \/><br \/>This a relatively fine grind. I'd call it the finest limit of drip coffee. Beyond that, we're getting into espresso territory.<br \/><br \/>Against my better judgement, I tried it in my French Press. The fine particles plug up the steel mesh making the plunger difficult to press. The finer particles got into the brew. There was a very thick sludge at the bottom of the cup. Flavor-wise, it was intense but not bad. There was a slight bitter taste and a silky texture which I suspect was from the dust in suspension. So I ran it through a cone filter. The resulting brew was still intense but lost all of the vanilla aroma. The texture was too thin. It basically became a better than average cup of diner coffee. Easy to drink, dark & tasty, but nothing to write home about.<br \/><br \/>I expected great results from the vacuum brewer. While brewing, it filled the kitchen with vanilla, but when I tasted the coffee, there was only a hint of it. I don't think it brewed long enough to pick up the vanilla, or maybe it was so hot the vanilla vaporized rather than dissolve. In any case, the final product was only slightly better than the pressed-then-filtered coffee above. Not recommended.<br \/><br \/>Surprisingly, the best results came from my drip machine. I used the freebie Gevalia gave me with membership (yeah, I'm a sucker for free stuff). I'm drinking the stuff now as I write this review and it's exceptional. I only used 2 Tbsp to 6 servings of water and the taste is just about right. It has a rich mouth-feel, a fair amount of vanilla aroma, a robust coffee taste.<br \/><br \/>I've bought and tasted flavored coffees before and have come to the conclusion that most of the manufacturers are just masking cheap, dry, tasteless coffee with deceptively sweet aromas. Those coffees rarely taste like coffee and never taste like the additional flavor, which is why I call them scented coffee rather than flavored coffee. So color me jaded. But the stuff from my drip machine actually TASTES LIKE VANILLA! And maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but I'm getting a hint of ice-cream too!

Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap.

One time when I made it, I measured out the whole package with my rice cooker cup (3.5 rice cooker cups) and added twice as much water (7 rice cooker cups). I took note of the water level in the rice cooker bowl (right at my Sweet 6 line). So now I can just dump the pouch in the bowl, fill with water up to the Sweet 6 line, set it to the brown rice setting, and start. That's it! My rice cooker brown rice setting takes 1 hr 45 minutes. I start it early in the day and the rice cooker keeps it warm until I'm ready for it. It always comes out light and fluffy. I have not tried it with the quick rice setting or on the stove-top, so I'm honestly not sure if there is any difference in taste or texture between the methods.<br \/><br \/>I make an entire package once or twice a week. My family of 5 eats about 1\/3 of it the first night and we finish it as leftovers over the next few days.

So take this into consideration with my review.<br \/><br \/>Instead of pouring the packet into a water bottle, I filled a Guinness pint glass about 3\/4 of the way full and added some ice before adding the packet.  I wasn't really sure how much water was the appropriate amount to be mixed.  I was delighted by the hot pink foamy action at the top of the glass, but after stirring it around with a spoon, the foam quickly disappeared and the powder all dissolved into the water.<br \/><br \/>On the plus side, the powder all dissolves.  There is no junk left at the bottom of the glass.  The color is very bright pink - almost fuchsia.  It seems a little artificial to me, but I'm not sure if it's a natural color for the pomegranate.  The very first taste was really good.  After the first sip, however, I realized it was going to take a lot for me to drink the entire glass.  It might be easier to drink this while you're working out very hard and are super thirsty and are more apt to take big, quick gulps.

Starbucks is usually very strong and bitter but this was not. It was mellow, tasteful, and the right amount of vanilla. It would be a product that I would purchase and brew at home.<br \/><br \/>That's some high praise from our regular cubicle coffee supplier!<br \/><br \/>Another person (our cubicle tea drinker) happily offered her opinion:<br \/><br \/>Very tasty.  To me the aroma is better than the taste though.  Is that their travel instant coffee?  If so, I like the caramel one better even though I really do like vanilla.  *grin*<br \/><br \/>And our official CS (Coffee Snob) had this to say:<br \/><br \/>It has a mild flavor.  Unlike most Starbucks coffees it does not have the bitter, highly acidic taste one comes to expect from Starbucks.  It does have a bit of a vanilla aftertaste that reminds this taster of French Vanilla ice cream...One cannot taste the strength of the roast and the coffee does not have the typical burned flavor of a Starbucks roast.

A lighter flavor and taste<br \/>3. It is a smooth coffee<br \/><br \/>The negatives are:<br \/><br \/>1. The vanilla aftertaste grows stronger the more coffee that I drink<br \/>2. It seems to be too light of a roast for my tastes, I prefer a medium to dark roast<br \/><br \/>And finally, our CSIT (Coffee Snob In Training) offered these thoughts:<br \/><br \/>This being a Starbucks blend, the initial taste does contain the trademark bitterness of Starbucks coffee, which may turn off the less seasoned coffee drinker...unlike most other vanilla coffee brews, there is no creamy texture to accompany the hint of vanilla.<br \/><br \/>On subsequent tastes, the vanilla flavor stays consistently subtle so as not to overpower the coffee's flavor.  When this blend is sweetened, however, the vanilla changes to a caramel flavor, which may disappoint those looking to be overcome with the subtle sweetness and aroma of Vanilla.  This blend is best enjoyed either lightly sweetened or unsweetened at all, which may leave many outside the ardent coffee drinker crowd with a bitter tasting disappointment.  True Brew lovers will no doubt appreciate a vanilla coffee that is more subtle and tastes like, well...coffee, and not a vanilla milkshake.<br \/><br \/>As for myself?<br \/><br \/>Well, I felt a hint of the bitters that Starbucks coffee is known for, but I was pleased to find the taste of vanilla with a hint of caramel (as previously stated).

The taste is smooth and fruity with no bitterness, but mild enough to use as a substitute for butter in most recipes.<br \/><br \/>It is good enough to stand alone with some good french bread and aged balsamic vinegar but inexpensive enough that we use it for all our cooking and sauces.

I was under the impression that these were 100% freeze dried raw chicken & turkey treats.  When the pkg. arrived I was disappointed to see that there are a heck of a lot of other ingredients.  Seems a high price to pay for a 4 ounce package of treats that don't have ingredients much different from top quality foods such as Wellness, Before Grain & others.  (Ingredient list is at the bottom of this review if you are looking for that info.)<br \/><br \/>These bites are only bite sized for medium to large dogs.  For my cats they are WAY too big.  I had to break them into at least 4 - 6 pcs. in order for the cats to be able to eat them.  Even with my breaking them up, the cats still had to work at them.  Their freeze dried condition creates a very airy & light biscuit that is spongy, not crunchy.  It seemed to stick to the cats teeth making it very difficult for them to eat.<br \/><br \/>The cats will ONLY eat these if they are very very hungry.  If I put down anything else, they will ignore the Boost Bites.  I also have barn cats that hunt pretty much everything so I feed them a cheap cat food.  I know they are getting tons of healthy nutrition in all the rodents, insects, birds, amphibians & grasses they can get their little paws on.  However they do enjoy their junk kibble.  Seeing how these Raw Boost Bites were an epic fail for the indoor cats, I tried it on the barn cats.  They were a tad more enthusiastic although they appreciated having the biscuits broken into bits too despite their bone crunching swallowing rodents whole abilities.  They struggled with the bites just as much as the indoor kitties.<br \/><br \/>The bites seem more suitable for a dog.  Dogs aren't known to do a lot of chewing & are not usually as fussy as a cat.  I doubt a spongy dry biscuit would matter to an animal that tends to wolf things down within a gulp or two.<br \/><br \/>Even though this is a product I'm not likely to buy in the future, I do not feel it deserves less than 3 stars when I think of all the disgusting garbage that is on store shelves for us to buy & poison our pets with.<br \/><br \/>Ingredients as per the box:<br \/>Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkin seeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flax seeds, Montomrillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols (note: probable GMO ingredient)with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin (note: this is being promoted as a prebiotic for fiber & digestive health.

Among the very finest bourbons.:<br \\\/> <\/b>Four Roses distillery is currently producing some of the best and most exciting bourbons in America, which may be news to you because that's a relatively recent development. Four Roses was a venerable 19th century brand and a top seller in the US until mid-century when then current owner Seagrams decided to export the good stuff to Europe and Asia and debase the brand by only selling low end blends in the US. That's how it was for almost 50 years. It wasn't until 1995 when master distiller Jim Rutledge came (and ownership changed a couple of times) that the brand became something good again. And not just good; extraordinary.<br \/><br \/>Four Roses makes a range of special limited releases as well as their standing specialties. Like a lot of high end bourbon distillers, they also make a single barrel version that varies from cask to cask. But Four Roses takes it a monumental level further by actually varying the recipe used to produce the bourbon - with startling different results. The ten different recipes Four Roses uses are described as followed on their web site:<br \/>From the Four Roses web site: Four Roses is the only Bourbon distillery that combines five proprietary yeast strains with two separate mashbills to produce 10 distinct and handcrafted Bourbon recipes, each with its own unique character, spiciness and rich fruity flavors.<br \/>...<br \/>What the letter designations mean for the 10 recipes:<br \/><br \/>O = Designates produced at the Four Roses Distillery in Lawrenceburg, KY.<br \/>E = The mashbill that is 75% corn, 20% rye, 5% malted barley.<br \/>B = The mashbill that is 60% corn, 35% rye, 5% malted barley.<br \/>S = Designates straight whiskey distillation.<br \/>V\/K\/O\/Q\/F = Yeast strain used to create flavor characteristics.<br \/><br \/>And here are the 10 recipes - along with the descriptions of flavor (and some have listings of the releases that featured that recipe:<br \/><br \/>OBSV - Delicate Fruit, Spicy, Creamy - Four Roses Single Barrel - 100, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release, Limited Edition 2010 Barrel Strength Bourbon<br \/>OBSK - Rich in Spiciness, Full Body - Small Batch, 120th Anniversary<br \/>OBSO - Slightly Fruity, Spicy, Medium Body - Four Roses Small Batch<br \/>OBSQ - Floral (Rose Petal), Spicy, Medium Body - Limited Edition 2011 Barrel Strength<br \/>OBSF - Mint, Fruity, Spicy, Full Body<br \/>OESV - Delicate Fruit, Fresh, Creamy<br \/>OESK - Spicy, Full Body - Four Roses Small Batch, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release<br \/>OESO - Fruity (Red Berries), Medium Body - 40th Anniversary Barrel Strength Bourbon, Four Roses Small Batch<br \/>OESQ - Floral, Banana, Fresh, Medium Body - 2009 Limited Edition Barrel Strength Bourbon<br \/>OESF - Mint, Fruity, Full Body<br \/>....<br \/><br \/>In this review I'm tasting a single barrel bottle from barrel 22-1B, warehouse BN, bottled at 53.6% using recipe OBSQ.<br \/><br \/>In the glass it's orangy copper new penny amber colored. The nose is sweet with honey, clover flower and the tang of grape noble rot (rancio in the cognac world). With more time more classicly bourbon notes of toffee and leather creep in<br \/><br \/>First entry is sugar beets with a rush of vinous rancio, white raisins, sherry notes. Mouth feel is silky with good but not thick syrup factor. Spicy around edge of tongue - 107.2 proof showing up. Herbal notes proliferate in the transition to the finish: cilantro and parsley... Maybe some ivy. As the glow fades the oak tannins join the medicinal herbal edge of bitterness and the honey and the sherry-cognac rancio ends up feeling almost dry. This is a sophisticated and elegant flavor profile that feels almost more like a wood aged European eau de vie than a Kentucky bourbon but inhaling as the long finish fades brings up echoes of burnt sugar, leather and tobacco conjured out the fading viney and herbal flavors so I know this is Kentucky Straight bourbon whiskey. Just bourbon of a higher and more refined sort.<br \/><br \/>This bourbon is so good, so different, so unique, I can't wait to try other single barrel expressions.

That refined salt in the grocery store is extremely damaging to your body, causing many problems like high blood pressure for one.<br \/><br \/>Your body desperately needs natural salt, but the refined versions most of us grew up with have had all the nutrients processed out of them.  There are something like 70 or 80 trace elements in a good sea salt that are essential for your body's health. Under ideal conditions, we would receive these from our food we eat.  But in today's world, the soil is depleted of these critical nutrients - so that even if you try to eat good natural food, it no longer contains what you need.  So sea salt to the rescue.<br \/><br \/>Having learned all this a few years back, I bought some Redmond's and gave it a try - and promptly went into shock.  I knew it would be good for me, but I still expected it to taste the same as all salt - but it was, OMG! THIS IS WHAT SALT IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE??!!!  It was a delightful bouquet of flavors and so satisfying to the taste buds.  Even if regular salt wasn't so bad for you, I could never go back just because of the taste - there is no comparison.<br \/><br \/>And don't be fooled by most grocery store brands - even Morton's sells sea salt - and it tastes just like the same old crap that's been in our salt shakers all these years.<br \/><br \/>One other tip to try:  I noticed another review mentioned that it helps with dehydration.  I also found out that if you become dehydrated - it is not a simple matter of just drinking lots of pure water to get re-hydrated.  I recently had a health professional suggest drinking a pinch of good sea salt in a glass of water before going to bed at night to help remedy the problem.\",\"B\":\"<b>The Princess of Hot Stuff:<br \\\/> <\/b>&quot;Hime&quot; is &quot;Princess Brand&quot; and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores.

What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said teabagging with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br \/><br \/>In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br \/><br \/>Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: This side down  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br \/><br \/>All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.

The only thing missing is the vodka but adventurous types can add that with no problem.<br \/><br \/>Crystal Light's Appletini Flavored Drink mix is guilt free as it is only 5 calories per serving, 90% fewer calories than other similar brands. The canister comes in a 1.69 oz. (48g) size containing 5 flavor packets which makes 2 quarts per packet. The pre-measured packets insure quick, easy, accurate and delicious Appletinis as swiftly as you can add 8 cups of water.

Look at the Ingredients:<br \\\/> <\/b>I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a very unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food.<br \/><br \/>The package states No fillers.  However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp.  The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers!  Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2]<br \/><br \/>As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk?<br \/><br \/>After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food.  When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours.  Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her.  Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams).<br \/><br \/>Yes, Iams is vet-recommended and my vet approved of it.  However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased.  Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes Hill's Science Diet with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world.  They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit.  In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4]<br \/><br \/>Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself!  It's a pay now or pay later situation.

If you are lucky to find it locally, buy a jar and you'll get instantly hooked. It tastes SO much better than regular canned tuna.<br \/><br \/>This is not the tuna you'd use for tuna salad or sandwiches, keep buying the regular canned tuna for that. The ventresca (fillets from the tender belly of the tuna) shines as the centerpiece of a salad (e.g., salade ni\u00e7oise) or on toasted rounds of baguette or crackers.<br \/><br \/>Six or so years ago I spotted the red label tuna jars at Trader Joe's; back then they were $4.99 which seemed rather expensive to me, but the tuna inside those jars looked so nice I just had to try it. The following week I bought a half dozen jars and kept replenishing my stock until TJ stopped carrying this tuna a couple of years later. I've been looking for it ever since, but very few stores carry it locally and the price has gone up quite a bit.<br \/><br \/>About a month ago I was very happy to find tuna Ventresca here, but it was by a different manufacturer (Roland) and it was canned. I ordered it, regardless, because the price was reasonable and I was hoping that the taste and texture would be the same as the Tonnino brand, but it wasn't.<br \/><br \/>Luckily, Ventresca by Tonnino is now available so I discontinued my Subscribed and Save order for the Roland brand and ordered two cases of this wonderful Ventresca packed in glass jars. It is so much better and, when you order two cases, the shipping cost stays almost the same which makes the price per ounce a few cents lower than the Ventresca by Roland deal, which comes in tins and is not as nice and silky as this brand.<br \/><br \/>I realize this review is rather wordy but I wanted to let the prospective buyers know that one can get a very good deal by ordering two cases.<br \/><br \/>Right now only two retailers carry this wonderful tuna Ventresca in my area and both charge $6.99 per jar.

There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the Midnight Magic brand; I've tried the Jet Fuel brand; I've tried the Donut Shop brand; I've tried all of the Extra Bolds; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br \/><br \/>What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br \/><br \/>There is no question here.

Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.

I can safely say that this vanilla is the best possible brand you can buy. The cold-extraction process that Nielsen-Massey uses creates a wonderfully smooth and rich flavor that is imparted onto my pastry items wonderfully.<br \/><br \/>Also, since I peruse vanilla products quite a bit, I see that people are always upset that extracts smell like there is a ton of alcohol included. THERE IS...it is kinda the point. The alcohol acts as the solvent that draws the essential oils out of the vanilla pod. It then holds that flavor (oils) in solution until it is placed into a recipe. When you add it to your cake batter for example, the alcohol then blends with the batter, distributing the vanilla flavor throughout. When you BAKE the cake, guess what happens to the alcohol? Yup, it evaporates, leaving the vanilla flavor behind. If you arent baking the product and are sensitive to the alcohol taste, I would advise letting whatever item you are making sit for 2 minutes immediately following the addition of the vanilla, the alcohol will evaporate this way as well. It is amazing that so many people think that  high-alcohol content extracts are bad...in actuality it is the other way around. Using alcohol is an expensive way to produce vanilla. In the cheaper brands, different forms of alcohol or organic solvents are used. Sorry, had to preach..see too many of these comments over the years.

I wasn't sure if my 1 year old daughter would like it or not, but I gave her a bite anyway.  She wanted another bite, and another, and another.

As your baby grows, you can stir in a baby cereal to thicken the puree.<br \/><br \/>I'm not sure why it's in a pouch rather than a jar or a plastic container, but I like it.  The twist-on cap can re-seal the pouch after you pour out exactly as much as you need.  Then it can be stored in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve more to your baby.  I'm sure they don't want you to allow your toddler to suck on the straw-like spout, and I'm sure it introduces germs into the rest of the food if you do that.  So, just because I let my toddler do that, doesn't mean it's the smartest way to handle this baby food.  The pouch should be easier to transport in a diaper bag than a glass jar and should seal better than the flimsy plastic containers with click-on lids.<br \/><br \/>So from myself, my one year, and my friend's 9 month old ... we definitely recommend the Baby Gourmet Stage 1 baby foods.\",\"C\":\"<b>tasty:<br \\\/> <\/b>it's a tasty tea.  handy packets to keep at work.

This makes re-mixing by shaking easier.<br \/><br \/>I measure my pH at least twice daily, prior to taking each dose, using the Urine test strips purchased through Amazon made by Phinex**.  These strips will also measure one's pH by testing saliva.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br \/>Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs\/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

Parker and Annie know anything [and they've probably assimilated a lot of knowledge], they know the LAWS OF INTEGRITY. Or they've discerned some of them over incredibly productive lifetimes.

They have no discernible odor to humans, yet my dog knew exactly what to do with it. Unlike commercially sold bones, this has no grease to mess up carpets or flooring. It does not splinter, so it is good for small or large dogs. These come not split for larger dogs, but I have found that the split antlers are best for my 20 pound puppy. He got his first split antler when he was only 5 pounds, and knew what to do with it, and loved it. Helped through the teething stage. Bought one for every room, and when he went after something, or me, to chew on, I would distract him with his antler. It worked! These are supposedly humanely found as deer and elk shed their antlers every year. I hope this is true, as you can't believe everything you read on the internet, but it does make sense! As they can make money doing nothing but finding cutting, and bagging these to sell. They aren't cheap, but they do last a long time. After the marrow has been chewed out, the antler can still be gnawed on, and will harmlessly flake off, and like bone, can be eaten. When the antler gets smaller, it should be replaced with a new one, as it could be swallowed whole in a smaller size. These have lasted for weeks! So the expense in my mind is well worth it. They do sell it by the weight of the dog, but use your common sense. A smaller one is not going to be any softer, than a larger one. The larger one will last longer than a smaller one, as long as it is not so large that the dog can't pick it up and carry it around.

With this machine you have to stop the water flow, it does not stop automatically.

However your shots may come out a little short due to the Necap not holding the same amount of coffee. The Necap will also deform due to the heat from the hot water. This is normal. I like using these very much. Making them is time consuming but then so is going to the Nespresso store to buy originals or going on line. If you want to save money and have time to do this then give them a try.<br \/><br \/>Tips:<br \/>Pack the coffee in tight using the bottom of an empty Necap. Don't do it so tight that it is like a rock. You also need to use espresso grind coffee. It does not have to be espresso beans, any bean will work but the coffee has to be ground on the finest setting for espresso machines.<br \/><br \/>1. Set out several Necaps<br \/>2. Use a funnel to fill to top, tap side of funnel to get coffee to go down.<br \/>3. Use bottom of empty Necap to compact coffee. Press firmly.<br \/>4. Fill up to top again and compact.<br \/>5. Put foil on and you are done.<br \/><br \/>You can also reload your Nespresso capsules using aluminum foil as a new cover. Cut the old foil away, rinse, clean out the used grounds, re-pack with new, place foil over and pinch tightly around rim of nespresso capsule, trim excess foil away. These can be used over about 2 times.<br \/><br \/>Remember to run some water through the machine to heat your cup and clean out any left over grinds to get a nice tasting cup of espresso.<br \/><br \/>My coffee makers that I have used are a T Fal drip, several different sized Bialetti Moka Express, an Aeropress, french press, my grandmas old perculator and currently the Nespresso Essenza C91.

For the record, we are 9 and 10 year old Yorkies and if you know anything about Yorkies we are weird when it comes to eating.  Sure we are adorable, loving and just the best pets in the world but we are picky when it comes to eating.  The humans, bless their heart, bring home some of the weirdest stuff you can imagine.  Stuff that comes in boxes, bags and who knows what else.  They got smart a few years ago and only bring home small bags, etc.  We take a sniff and walk away unless we like the stuff.  If we don't like it, they give it to some other dog and that poor old thing is huge, loved and not lacking for food.  He has his own stimulus plan.<br \/><br \/>Sorry for the elaborate history but Hartz has done it again.  We really like these small biscuits and know full well that the humans will get more.

What you'll find is that even the supposed high-end lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br \/><br \/>This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br \/><br \/>What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like liver flavor (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).

Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar.

Really?:<br \\\/> <\/b>OK, let's start with the most important aspect of a performance drink - does it do what it advertises to do.  For me, the answer is a resounding YES.  Cytomax does everything the marketing department says it does for beating the burn and fast recovery.  I've been using this stuff off and on since the product came out, first discovering it in a local bike shop.  Once in a while, I tried another brand because of their marketing or the advice of a cyclist\/athlete.  Every time, I came back to Cytomax; it's the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  The one disagreement I have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not taste great.  Not even close to great.  Orange?  Really?  Whatever.  Tangy?  Pffft.  To me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. If that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  I mix it with green tea instead of water, my version of an Arnold Palmer, and it is reasonably presentable to the palate.  Use Luzianne Green Tea and you get the added benefit of antioxidants.  Yep, Amazon has it.  The 1.5lb Cytomax container provides 27 servings, or about 9 rides, so you may need to buy more than one.

The last time I ran out, Amazon was not selling the brand I was buying (wild planet) so I looked for alternatives.<br \/><br \/>I could not really find an alternative on Amazon.com that actually identified itself as low mercury. Low mercury tuna that I could find outside Amazon.com is very expensive plus you have to pay shipping. One brand that Amazon does sell - Crown Prince - says that their tuna is Dolphin-safe and line caught. Usually, the line-caught and troll-caught tuna from the Pacific Ocean is lower in Mercury than the typical tuna you find from brands like Starkist and Chicken-of-the-Sea. I also read a story recently that the high amount of selenium in tuna actually helps bind with mercury in tuna to negate its effects.<br \/><br \/>According to several articles I found, the interactions between dietary selenium and mercury are now the topic of exciting new research. Some of those studies were presented at a recent scientific meeting dedicated to the subject. The First International Symposium on Selenium and Mercury Interactions, was held February 22-24, 2007 in La Jolla, California. The symposium assembled scientists from the US, Japan, Spain, Ireland, Slowenia, Denmark and elsewhere to share information on selenium and mercury interactions and health effects.<br \/><br \/>Of particular interest was a paper given by Dr. Nicholas Ralston of the Energy and Environmental Research Center in North Dakota on the biochemical basis of selenium's protective effects on mercury toxicity. Selenium has an extremely high binding attraction and strength with mercury, forming a biologically inactive compound, mercury selenide.<br \/><br \/>But how much selenium is in tuna? All tuna species sampled, including bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and skipjack contained a healthy excess of selenium over the mercury content. For this reason, eating tuna, an excellent source of selenium, is more likely to protect against mercury toxicity, than cause it.<br \/><br \/>So, that was enough for me to give this tuna a try. From Amazon, it comes in a 12-pack case with free shipping. The price per can is very good. The tuna tastes great and the 12-oz can is a good size for me and my wife who like to mix it with low fat miracle whip, mustard, chopped onions, and green & red peppers and eat it with corn chips or make paninis.

Good strong Lipton flavors, very sweet for the sweet tea lovers, but I like mine less so, thus, here's what I do.<br \/><br \/>I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. The flavor was fruity, as good as I expected after trying another flavor earlier. I've tried lots of flavored teas from other makers and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton. This is different, it's good.<br \/><br \/>IT'S HEALTHY, BUT IT CAN BE MADE EVEN BETTER (IF NEEDED.)<br \/>FOR 8 OZ (that's half a packet, as the packet makes over 16 oz.) you get ZERO Fat & Sodium. Sugar's only 1g (per 8 oz.), calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me.<br \/>After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. By doing this you cut the nutrituion facts in half (per 8 oz serving). WOW. Even better. Now the bold Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate and or mango Pineapple flavor is still there, but less sweet. I enjoy the drink's fizz from the soda. Remember equal club soda\/water mixed with the same amount of Lipton mixed as directed has a serving size (8oz) calorie cut to 2 \u00bd, sugar only 1\/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br \/><br \/>Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br \/><br \/>Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br \/>I'm sold, 2 flavor attempts and both very satisfying to me. Now, which flavor should I try next?<br \/><br \/>Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and Bob's your Uncle.\",\"A_id\":194826,\"B_id\":371632,\"C_id\":70173}}"},

This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes, but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. What's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins\/minerals (not as much as some cereals, but since I have no deficiencies in this area, I didn't mind). Also, it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED. A can of healthy choice soup, now that is loaded with salt.<br \/><br \/>Now, I chose this cereal as a replacement for Frosted Flakes\/Honey Nut Cheerios, which against my better judgment I continued to have every morning. I should point out that I don't drink coffee in the mornings and I don't drink soda (less than 1 a week on average). I also eat no sweets.  Simple sugars (listed as just Sugars on the nutrition label) seem to be treated like carcinogens, while most people don't realize that aspartame (artificial sweetener in most diet sodas) really is one. If your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick (since I don't drink caffeinated drinks, I need that jolt in the morning), then this is a good choice. If your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars (or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning), then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups (which I really do not like that much). Also, if you are concerned about the total carbs, please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates (so yes, high protein diets contradict  this).<br \/><br \/>Since taste is completely subjective, I won't put much emphasis on it.

He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br \/>So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br \/>So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br \/>Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br \/>( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )\",\"A_id\":381271,\"B_id\":352557,\"C_id\":165404}}"},

For many years, I have been addicted to Starbucks Black Iced Tea.  I live in a little town in the midwest that doesn't even have a Starbucks, but I have a gold Starbucks card.

I have purchased the quart sized bags from Starbucks and Target when available and ordered the gallon bags when that was my only option to brew this tea daily.  I started noticing a change when I was in South Carolina in March, 2012.  I thought maybe southerners just have a different tea preference.  I then noticed it in Nashville over the summer.  Since I spend time regularly in Nashville, I knew a change was on the way.  The tea has lost its crispness and citrus finish.  It seems Starbucks has purchased Tazo from Steven Smith and decided to change it.  I hate to think it was to make more money with a cheaper blend, but I haven't been able to find another reason.  Given the fact that I was paying over $3.00 per Trenta, I can't imagine the mark up was unfair to them no matter what the cost of the original tea.  By buying Tazo, Starbucks cut out the middle man to make way for more profits, then made major change.  Couldn't it just have started its own tea brand?  It has lost a loyal customer in me (and many transfers from my bank account to the Starbucks card).  If you are loyal to taste rather than brand, start your search for a new tea.  I have started my search with the former owner of Tazo who has opened a new business.

The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs. Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

I have been using the Takeya 64 oz iced tea maker with one bag of Passion to make this iced tea and find the tea to be refreshing and healthy.  In my brew there is enough tart and just enough sweet and I've been drinking it almost every day since I got the tea and tea maker.  In fact, I was a bit worried I'd like it too much and get sick of it fast, so I picked up a box of Celestial's Wild Berry Zinger (first ingredient is hibiscus) for some variety and was pretty disappointed -- it tastes like a watered-down diet fruit punch drink.  Passion, on the other hand, is almost like the Mexican drink Jamaica (also made from hibiscus), except less sweet of course, and actually tastes like a real tea unlike Celestial's Zinger.<br \/><br \/>How I brew the Passion:<br \/>-Fill Takeya 64 ounce iced tea maker almost to the top with filtered water.<br \/>-Add 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice (or up to one lemon).<br \/>-Add three tablespoons of Erythritol sweetener.<br \/>-Add one bag of Passion iced tea to infuser and let cold brew overnight.\",\"A_id\":97752,\"B_id\":233602,\"C_id\":132633}}"},

It was nice that they sent a whole pack this time since it allowed both me and my son to try them out.<br \/><br \/>If you look at the ingredients there is no added sugar, the sweetener is apple juice.  There are also some added vitamins in there which is an interesting idea for a fruit snack.<br \/><br \/>When I tried them I thought there were very tart, almost sour, and definitely not overly sweet.  I liked the tartness though, as I am not a big sweet person.  They require a small effort to chew off a bite; not like jerky but tougher than a fruit roll-up.  I was worried that my 20 month old son would have trouble eating them because of the chewiness.<br \/><br \/>Well, my 20 month old would give them 6 stars if he could.  He loves them.  I was surprised he liked them so much since they are a bit sour.  He does have to work some at chewing them; but he seems to like that, he kind of uses them as a teether.  Also they are coated in a light layer of oil so they aren't too sticky in his hands.  I don't know if I will get to eat any more of them because he got the box of them off the counter and has declared that the Fruities are mine!  I finally had to hide the box after he ate two of them, so he would lay off and find something else to do :-)<br \/><br \/>All in all a great snack.  I like that all of the sugar is from fruit, that there are some added vitamins, and the taste is great too.  Great snack for my toddler too!\",\"C\":\"<b>Fruity Taste, Not Artificial Like Others.:<br \\\/> <\/b>I am NOT a plain water drinker.  Even bottled water needs some enhancement for me.  While the best and most natural way to enhance the flavor of plain water is by squeezing fresh lemon or lime or orange into it, that tends to get boring AND expensive.  I received my 12 oz bottle of Fruit Punch flavored Vitamin Squeeze Energy a couple of days ago.  This product is housed in the upside down type bottles that are currently popular.  The top of the bottle features a snap lid that allows you to squeeze the product out slowly or quickly and it also allows you to turn the cap so it is removed entirely if you prefer to pour the product in a larger pitcher of water.<br \/><br \/>I have tried other water enhancer products such as the one that is spelled with a certain 3 letters.  I did not care for those as they had left a weird chemical taste in my mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Vitamin Squeeze.  This did not taste in any way to me like a no cal product.  I squeezed about 1\/2 of a tablespoon into a 12 oz glass of filtered water and I thought I was drinking a watered down version of Hi-C fruit punch. All I tasted was fruit.  I didn't taste any diet sweetener at all.<br \/><br \/>I looked at the differences in the ingredient labels of Vitamin Squeeze and that other enhancer brand I mentioned above.  Vitamin Squeeze does not have any ingredients I cannot pronounce nor any that I am not familiar with.<br \/><br \/>Here are the ingredients listed in order on the bottle:<br \/><br \/>Water<br \/>Citric Acid (not Malic Acid like in other enhancers)<br \/>Vitamin C<br \/>Natural Flavor<br \/>Sucralose<br \/>Natural Caffeine<br \/>Sodium Benzoate<br \/>Potassium Sorbate<br \/>Magnesium Lactate (Electrolyte)<br \/>Vitamin B3<br \/>Taurine (ingredient in an energy drink known to give you wings)<br \/>Vitamin B5<br \/>Calcium Lactate<br \/>Potassium Phosphate<br \/>Gum Ascacia<br \/>Glyceryl Abietate<br \/>Red 40<br \/>Vitamin B6<br \/><br \/>Now, the ingredients that are giving you energy are the Taurine, the natural caffeine (but I don't know the source of the natural caffeine) and the B Vitamins.  The Electrolytes I understand as well.  The only ingredient problem I have with this product is the Red #40.  WHY do we have to have this product colored?  Is it a psychological thing?  I would be happy to drink my water CLEAR.  As long as there is some flavor in it I do not need to psych myself into thinking I am drinking something other than water by making it a different color.<br \/><br \/>When I first opened this bottle and started squeezing I found leaks around the bottom edge of the screw on cap.  I was getting irritated and was going to blast the design in my review.  Then I started to think about it and unscrewed the cap.  When I first opened the protective paper opening I had only torn a triangle around 1\/3 of the paper.  This was what was causing the leakage.  Remove the ENTIRE opening protector and you won't have the problem I had.  However, that said, when you are squeezing the bottle into a glass hold the bottle completely vertical because you will get a surprise squirt rebound if you don't.  LOL.  This product will stain your clothing and counter and floor.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I really like this product.  Have I noticed an energy boost?  I don't know really but at least I am not getting a crash like after drinking other well known canned energy drinks.  I will keep using it and update this review if I have any issues with it.  I would give it 5 stars but I don't like the coloring and the fact that it stains everything so 4 stars it is.<br \/><br \/>EDIT 3\/23\/12:  The lid STILL leaks even with the paper protection completely removed.  I guess I just won't store the bottle upside down in the fridge but be wary if you are going to transport it in a purse or tote!\",\"A_id\":257750,\"B_id\":466818,\"C_id\":543790}}"},

Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.<br \/><br \/>COOKING<br \/><br \/>The cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1\/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.<br \/><br \/>EATING<br \/><br \/>These oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were nuttier in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the slime feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.<br \/><br \/>NUTRITION<br \/><br \/>I found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.<br \/><br \/>REPEAT PURCHASE<br \/><br \/>Now that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost.\",\"B\":\"<b>Tasty and lots of good ingredients, but very SWEET:<br \\\/> <\/b>I usually eat Kashi granola and was interested to try this product.

{"data": "{\"compare\":{\"A\":\"<b>Not very Fig-y:<br \\\/> <\/b>For a product that calls itself Fruit Thins, my first question after trying one has to be where's the fruit?  There is a decidable lack of fig and\/or fig-taste in these cookies.  The fig that is in there consists of dry and tasteless little chopped bits that are often so hard that sometimes you think you might have bitten a stray piece of shell.  These hard bits have a tendency to get stuck in your teeth where they soften to the point of sticky.  Yuck.<br \/><br \/>As for the cookie part, that's a different story.  The cookie itself is thin, light, and crisp, and has a nice honey flavor.  However, if you're a Fig Newton lover thinking to give these a try as an alternative to the original, then my advice would be to stick with the old fruit and cake and give these a miss.\",\"B\":\"<b>Not All Natural:<br \\\/> <\/b>This product works but the advertising is misleading. Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree, and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China, where it's made from corn, it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But,on the ingredients list, xylitol is the last ingredient, meaning, that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?\",\"C\":\"<b>Tasty snacking!:<br \\\/> <\/b>Love this stuff. Not overly sweet, but packed with flavor.

There are half a dozen partially-empty bottles sugar-free syrup of different brands in my kitchen (OK, I need to clean!) that I just stopped using because they weren't good.<br \/><br \/>Joseph's is the first sugar free syrup that tastes like real syrup. It has a thicker texture than genuine maple syrup - closer to honey or even molasses, really. In fact, if it's coming from the fridge, I'd suggest putting it in a small bowl or container and popping it in the microwave for a few seconds to make it thin enough to pour. But the taste is perfect.

Not to be confused with the incredible Old Vine limited edition released last year which made my Best of 2011 list, this wine stands on its own two feet (for US readers, note that restaurants have a mevushal version of this wine, while retailers primarily sell a non-mevushal version).  A full bodied wine comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot (33%) and Petit Verdot (2%), with each component aged independently for two years in mostly new oak before being blended together.  A rich nose of black forest fruit, cedar, chocolate and some herbs are backed up by a solid core or big tannins that are nicely integrating with the fruit and wood.  The palate has more black fruit, cedar and some spicy oak together with some Mediterranean herbs, wet forest floor and some more chocolate with a hint of pleasing bitterness.  A long, gripping and luxurious finish rounds out this wine.<br \/><br \/>To sign up for Yossie's free weekly newsletter on kosher wines and see his reviews and articles, check out: [...]\",\"A_id\":15042,\"B_id\":551812,\"C_id\":390138}}"},

Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our local Starbucks, which is 90 miles away, I discovered the VIA decaf Italian Roast and bought a three pack for him to try. He likes strong, good coffee and was impressed after his first cup. He took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee, too, when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the VIA. I've placed a pre-order for the 50 pack available through Amazon and from now on when we travel, he will be carrying a supply of decaf Italian Roast VIA with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf.

Since I don't use any form of sugar or sugar substitute, I've used it as a sweetener on my plain yogurt or on oatmeal, that type of thing. I use it in place of plain cinnamon many times, for instance, on top of apple sauce or crushed pineapple.<br \/><br \/>The only thing I'd recommend is putting a plastic shaker top onto the jar so you can sprinkle out the 5 Spice.

There is definitely a onion-y powder used in this. I found it to be nice and subtle throughout the serving. I like to keep myself at 10 rice cakes per serving, and the first rice cake was heavily flavored, while the rest imparted a more pepper and salt type of flavor, with the onion as a side note. I suspect the reason for the first cake seeming so powerful is because it was the first to hit my palate, and not because of over powdering. As the palate acquires the onion flavor, it will bring itself down. This is my observation anyway.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I was not expecting much from the flavor, but was pleasantly surprised! I would recommend this to people who enjoy sour cream and onion flavored items. I am happy with this flavor.\",\"A_id\":173479,\"B_id\":193122,\"C_id\":95908}}"},

Generally I find most to have overcooked pasta and generally bland sauces.  Until now, I've not tried a Barilla product.<br \/><br \/>This one was a bit different than others I've eaten in that the pasta is actually cooked al dente which was a pleasant surprise!  The sauce is bright and flavorful for a basic marinara type sauce and has a hint of basil.  In another surprise there were also a few chunks of tomato in the sauce.  The amount of sauce works perfectly for the amount of pasta with a portion size that is good for lunch.  Add a small side salad and and a piece or two of garlic bread and this could easily work as an evening meal.<br \/><br \/>Preparation is quick and easy.  1 minute or so (may need longer in smaller microwave ovens) to a hot meal.  I appreciated the sauce being in a separate, removable, container in the package both for mixing with the pasta and the ability to heat it separately an additional few seconds if desired.  Frankly, this design is what keeps the pasta cooked properly as it's not sitting in the sauce on the shelf becoming softer with time.  Just be careful pulling that cover off as it's very well attached and if not removed with caution can easily create a lunch disaster with hot sauce covering everything.<br \/><br \/>Yes, you could make your own for less money but it's comparable in price to competing, less flavorful, products and less expensive than similar dishes at corporate fast-food establishments.<br \/><br \/>Overall a very tasty and convenient product for portable meal needs.\",\"C\":\"<b>Good idea, but I wish they'd use Stevia:<br \\\/> <\/b>It's hard to believe this Crystal Light Moctails Mojito mix doesn't have any sodium, because it tastes a bit like a margarita.

Of course, I suppose you could tipple in some suitable spirits if you wanted to.<br \/><br \/>What this product does have is the sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium, and I suspect the aftertaste of these in combination is what makes this Crystal Light drink taste a little salty. I know these sweeteners are chosen in part because of the long shelf life, not to mention being lower in calories than sugar, but I wish the manufacturer would consider a line using Stevia as a sweetener instead. I'd be more inclined to purchase this product if they did. I am particularly sensitive to aspartame (acesulfame potassium is a new one on me), so I tend to avoid it. The mix also contains a trivial amount of sugar, whatever that means.<br \/><br \/>Otherwise, this Crystal Light is easy to mix. The package comes with five packets, each of which mixes up into 2 quarts.

It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br \/><br \/>Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character Beetlejuice- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br \/><br \/>It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife\/mother of a family who moves into a haunted house inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br \/><br \/>Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br \/><br \/>Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife.

All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003M7TTYG>Green Mountain's Revv<\/a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br \/><br \/>Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B004M5W7YQ>Emeril's Big Easy Bold<\/a>.

You can add a variety of vegetables, chicken pieces, pork, beef or shrimp if you like, and chopped spinach and if you love tofu you can add either the firm or soft variety, I prefer the soft.<br \/>The soup is comprised of fermented soy beans and comes in red (sweeter) or white (saltier) miso paste and fish stock made from bonito flakes and contains kelp as well. I am going to a local Asian market where I live and make my own miso from scratch but bought more of this as backup just in case mine doesn't turn out. It is a very delicate soup and cannot ever be boiled once the bonito is added as it would collapse and the flaovr would be ruined, so I watched videos on how to prepare it.<br \/>Many years ago when I was in college in downtown Los Angeles, we would go to little Tokyo for lunch and indulge in the then relatively unknown treat, sushi and have the miso and a wonderful salad of finely chopped cabbage and rice vinegar to start.<br \/>Now I can buy (and do) sushi freshly prepared at my local supermarket and have instant miso whenever I want and that is my idea of Heaven. Miso has the most delicate flavor imaginable, it is absolutely unique, nothing else tastes remotely like it and it is very healthy for you as well.<br \/>When I went to a fat farm the main reason we all lost so much weight was because the diet plan at this particular place included having a large cup of hot broth before every meal thus cutting the appetite down considerably. I could really put it away before, just huge gluttonous portions, but after finishing the cup of broth, I could eat what they gave us but no more than that.<br \/>So whether you want in instant soup like no other or want to incorporate this soup into your diet plan, either way you'll be very happy and remember to experiment by adding whatever you like and making it more of a meal.<br \/>To paraphrase a quote from Benjamin Franklin (re beer) miso is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy.

The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty.

Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br \/>Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or natural preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br \/>Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?\",\"B\":\"<b>Aspen Mulling Eggnog Mix:<br \\\/> <\/b>Aspen Mulling eggnog mix does not taste exactly like real eggnog, but pretty darn close.

Yes, wish there was another way of packaging it, but I suppose it has to come frozen so at this point Styrofoam may be the only option... but then I am no logistic\/shipping expert so don't know what other options are out there for frozen product shipping that are a bit more environmental friendly and\/or recyclable.<br \/><br \/>I signed up for a 4-month plan they offer for the Mommy Club members listed on their website. The owners are great about taking suggestions and trying to improve product line and shipping methods - I was called about recycling the Styrofoam container... that they will send a return label with my next shipment so I should return it to them and they can keep using the same container for each of my monthly order or until the container lasts so that's little better than having a new container each month.<br \/><br \/>Products - I have tried all variety from Creamy Yummy and now starting to try to Mushy Yummy! My baby loves pretty much all creamy variety. I even did my own mixing at home - like mix creamy carrots with creamy peas, creamy butternut squash with broccoli or green beans and all such combination as my baby didn't really warm up to peas by itself! :) I add the Happy Baby rice, multi-grain, or Oatmeal cereals to the veggies and to fruits to make it little more flavorful for my baby. In morning, I give the entire fruit portion mixed with 3 tbl spoons of cereal (used to also add formula or breast milk when first introduced Yummy solids, but now mix only the fruit and cereal) and rest of day I give a veggie combo with like 1 tbl spoon of cereal. Unless my baby is tired or sick, she eats the whole portion.<br \/><br \/>Cost - Yes, it's expansive at $2 for each 4 Oz container compared to Earth's Best or Full Circle or even Gerber Organic baby food, which by the way, are jar baby food and not frozen like Yummy's. It's your pick what you do want to give your baby and I know we all want the best for our babies so one choice over another may not be bad - just what you are comfortable with and what works with your own lifestyle and budget!<br \/><br \/>Savings\/Discount Option - I called the owners asking about discount since I ordered a lot in one order and was told that they offer something called Mommy Club. So if I join the Mommy Club, which means sign up for a 4 month commitment to order at least 84 containers (7 cases) each month in any verity of baby food from Creamy or Mushy line then I'd get each 4 Oz container at a discounted rate of $1.60 per container or something like that plus any shipping cost. So I thought that was much better than $2 per container and I was going to order from them anyway for next 2-3 months so thought signing up with the Mommy Club was a good option for me!! Yes, shipping is still very costly and that's the only reason I gave this a 4 start rating rather than 5 - wish shipping could be a little less costly at this price of product!<br \/><br \/>So those wanting to order longterm, don't forget to call or sign up with the Mommy Club to take advantage of the savings in cost per product.<br \/><br \/>They are also flexible on monthly order volume if you just cannot get to 84 containers each month or take a little more than a month to make the next order... so just call and ask for the details.<br \/><br \/>In my first monthly order, I got a free Yummy Baby bib, too... that was cool.<br \/><br \/>I made a suggestion on adding certain grains and cereals to Yummy product line to the owners and they said they are looking into it and probably will have it available around June 2010 timeframe so I am looking forward to that.

I hope Yummy also adds probiotic and other nutrition to their cereals like Happy Baby does!<br \/><br \/>Overall, I can't be happier with the product given that I am a working mother and do not have the time to consistently make my own at home, at least not the variety of fruits and veggies that Yummy offers!\",\"B\":\"<b>Freeze Dried:<br \\\/> <\/b>I purchased the product because I am using the Medifast diet program and I had to stop drinking coffee.

As far as I see it here are the major issues with the unit:<br \/><br \/>1.  Undersized failure prone pump.  We had and have pump issues, a lot of the reviews here mention it, and even their website is once again backordered.  If they'd gone with even a slightly larger pump they'd have only a fraction of these issues.  The filter is also directly placed against the pump, this dramatically drops it's efficiency and means the slightest amount of debris will completely obstruct the pump.<br \/><br \/>2.  Underpowered lighting that forces you to either stick with the fixed times hardwired into the unit (computerized!) or buy an additional cord, because other than using a non-standard fitting (so you have to buy another cord) the lights themselves plug into rather specialized fixtures which mostly eliminates your ability to just swap BETTER units in.  The lights that come stock are neither particularly efficient or very high in output.<br \/><br \/>There's no easy solution for the pump issue, the quality control on them is so poor it seems to be a very hit or miss prospect to find one that works long term.  The lighting is also an issue, as you'll be seriously restricted in what plants you can grow well with fixed photoperiods and relatively low light intensity.<br \/><br \/>Overall I would not recommend this unit to anyone.  There are far better designed and less failure prone systems that have already been on the market for years.

My daughter and son-in-law, and my colleague also enjoy it. I tried my colleagues and am ordering my own.\",\"C\":\"<b>Great Product!!!:<br \\\/> <\/b>I love the burst of energy that I get and I only need to drink half a bottle to get me thru the day. The best part is that I dont crash later in the day.\",\"A_id\":5525,\"B_id\":346143,\"C_id\":150794}}"}]
